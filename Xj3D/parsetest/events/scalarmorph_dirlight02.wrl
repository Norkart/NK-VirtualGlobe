# [meta] description: Test of basic functionality. A ScalarInterpolator node is used to change the intensity of a SpotLight that illuminates a Cylinder geometry. The fraction_changed field of a TimeSensor node is used to change the position from keyValues of [ 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5 0.0 ] for keys of [ 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 ] respectively. As a result: the Cylinder geometry will increase from no illumination to maximum illumination, then decrease to no illumination over a 5 second time interval.
