# [meta] description: Test PixelTexture mapping to an IndexedFaceSet geometry. By projecting the image through the geometry bounding box face with the long and second-longest axes, and onto the IndexedFaceSet geometry, faces between the front and back are smeared with the horizontal size of the bouding box. Any ImageTexture pixels extending beyond the geometry in the +T direction are removed to prevent image wharping. As a result, the top of the VTS logo should appear chopped off.
