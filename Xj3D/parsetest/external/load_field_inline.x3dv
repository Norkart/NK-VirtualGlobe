#X3D V3.0 utf8

# Test for the load field of the Inline node. This field only appears in X3D.
# It controls when the box should be loaded and not loaded. On the right is a
# box that has a touch sensor that is used to control the load state of the 
# inline on the right. Successive clicks on the right box should make the left
# box appear and disappear.
