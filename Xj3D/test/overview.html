<body>

Xj3D is a series of libraries that form a toolkit that can be used to
load and render VRML97 and X3D files.
<p>

The aim of the codebase is to provide a series of easily separable components
to enable VRML and X3D content either as a full browser, static geometry or
even as a component of a bigger application. The major goal of the code is to
provide a highly flexible <i>set</i> of libraries that you may take and use
to generate renderable content. If you combine them all together you could
create a complete browser that we intend to be spec-conformant. The codebase
itself is <i>not</i> a VRML/X3D browser, although you can create one from
this code (see some of the example directories along with this distribution
for an idea how).
<p>

The code is broken into 4 major sections:
<ol>
<li>Low level VRML lexical parser with a callback based API</li>
<li>Definitions of VRML content, structure and generators</li>
<li>A Java 3D implementation of the VRML scenegraph</li>
<li>A DOM/XML parser representation of the VRML Scenegraph</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the Code</h2>

When you start to use the code in an application, it will not automatically
allow you to do everything. For example, standard Java 3D loaders do not
support the idea of scripting or of Inline content. To deal with this, you
must also perform some auxillary support work so that everything works as
expected.
<p>

<h3>Loading External Content</h3>

To make life easier for our implementation, we have made use of quite a number
of 3RD party libraries to build a fully capable browser. The major reason for
this is that the inbuilt Java libraries are pretty terrible for the
requirements of a VRML browser. Firstly we need full URI support - Java does
not handle URNs that are used by the Universal Media libraries. Next, the
image loading of standard Java is very bloated, consuming way too much
memory. Then, to transport them across to the texture mapping used we have
to make several copies of the image each time, so we bring in a library for
more efficient image handling.
<p>

The next step is to use local libraries for specific areas such as Java 3D
support. These libraries make a lot of things simpler by allowing us to not
have to code them again. There are many similarities between VRML and the
3D graphics scenegraph APIs and these libraries act as the translator between
the two systems.
<p>

<h3>Preparation Work</h3>

Internally the code does not connect a lot of the parts together. For example,
Inlines are not automatically loaded as there are cases where you don't want
the code to handle them. You may also want to specifically handle different
content. Therefore, the Inlines are only loaded once you register the
appropriate handlers with the URI system. We won't detail that here, but
refer you to the applicable packages - {@link org.web3d.net.content} and
{@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader}. There are a collection of properties
and factories that need to be set if you want loading of external files
like textures, scripts and Inlines to work correctly.

<h2>System Properties</h2>

There are two ways of controlling the runtime configuration of Xj3D. Apart
from providing your own implementation of the various toolkits, the standard
Java mechanisms of properties files and system properties also apply.

<h3>Property Files</h3>

Property files are used to control large collections of properties. The
following properties files are used by the system (path information is
relative to the CLASSPATH as per System.getProperty()):

<dl>
<dt><code>vrml.properties</code></dt>
<dd>Defined by the EAI to control various
    items of configuration. Principally used to set the default factory class
    to use for {@link vrml.eai.BrowserFactory}
</dd>
<dt><code>xj3d.properties</code></dt>
<dd>System setup properties for the Xj3D project.
    File is currently only used for the definition of profiles and components
    and where to find further definition files.
</dd>
<dt><code><i>profile_name</i>.properties</code></dt>
<dd>Definition of a particular
    profile. The name of the file must be all lower case. The contents define
    each component and level used by that profile.
</dd>
<dt><code>org/web3d/x3d/jaxp/dom/x3d.props</code></dt>
<dd>Mapping of profile names
    to their DTD classes. (This has not yet been updated for the latest
    draft specification system)
</dd>
<dt><code>org/web3d/vrml/renderer/<i>component_name</i>.props</code></dt>
<dd>Definiton of a particular component. Includes information about the
    packages for each renderer and the nodes used at each level.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>System Properties</h3>

The codebase makes reasonable use of system properties to allow the
modification of its behaviour. These properties are sprinkled liberally about
the code, making them sometimes hard to find. This is a summary of all those
properties. Please be aware that these will need to be set before you run any
code from this library because most of them will be used during the
construction phase of any class.

<dl>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader.threads</code></dt>
<dd>The number of concurrent threads to be started to do loading. There are
    two areas which use this - script loading and all other files. Each loader
    creates this number of threads in the pool.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.parser.factory</code></dt>
<dd>The fully qualified class name
    of the parser factory implementation to be loaded. Allows the ability to
    control the parser in use independently of the scenegraph building process.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.script.loader.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader.ScriptLoader}
    interface, which is used for loading scripts.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.script.manager.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.runtime.ScriptManager}
    interface, which is used for managing scripts.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.file.loader.class</code></dt>
<dd>the name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader.ExternalLoadManager} interface,
    which is used for loading content other than scripts.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.router.manager.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.runtime.RouteManager}
    interface, which is used for managing routes.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.router.factory.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.runtime.RouterFactory}
    interface, which is used for creating routers.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.frame.state.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.FrameStateManager}
    interface, which is used for managing per-frame state.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.sensor.manager.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.renderer.j3d.input.J3DSensorManager} interface, which
    is used for managing sensors. There are renderer-specific sub-interfaces
    of this interface which the implementing class must also adhere to.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.eventmodel.evaluator.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.runtime.EventModelEvaluator} interface,
    which is used for runing the event model.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.staticgroup.dispose</code></dt>
<dd>Boolean value describing whether the static group should dispose of the
    VRML node children. This is an efficiency measure that will allow an
    implementation to remove unneeded memory. However, it also means
    that they can no longer be traversed, so if your application is
    trying to traverse the scene graph, it will not be able to use the
    nodes later on. Useful for a runtime optimisation, no good if you are
    writing an editor. Defaults to false.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.staticgroup.compact</code></dt>
<dd>Boolean value describing whether the static group should compact the VRML
    scenegraph below this node or leave it in an expanded state. This is
    an efficiency measure that will allow an implementation to flatten
    the scene graph if desired. Useful for debugging but also means the
    runtime scene graph will probably be different from the original
    loaded from file. Defaults to false.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.fontstyle.font.size</code></dt>
<dd>The font size in points. The default value is 36 point font.
</dd>
</dl>
