Utility classes to convert an arbitrary X3D DOM into a Java3D runtime structure
that may be executed and displayed.
<p>

The implementation is partially limited in how it functions. If the DOM is
capable of supporting DOM 2 events then we will register and operate event
listeners between the DOM and the rendering core. However, we cannot operate
in the opposite direction - changes in the rendering core are not currently
reflected in the DOM as attributes and structure changes.
