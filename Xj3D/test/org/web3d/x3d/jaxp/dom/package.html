Classes that provide X3D DOM document capabilities.
<P>

The classes here can be used to create a DOM model from scratch. There are
two ways of doing this: either through a parser for an existing document or
by building a new document programmatically.
<P>

<H3>Document Parsing</H3>

To parse a document to return these classes, it is advised that you use the
{@link org.web3d.x3d.jaxp.X3DDocumentBuilderFactory} in the parent package.
This will automatically create a document of the correct type and populate it
accordingly.
<P>

<H3>New Document Building</H3>

If your application would like to build a new document from scratch, then it
will start with the {@link org.web3d.x3d.jaxp.dom.X3DDocument} as an instance.
You can then provide profile information for the types of nodes to be built.
As per the W3C DOM recommendations, you should build the documents based on
the Document class and it's methods. If you do this, then it will guarantee
a model that implements both the SAI and DOM classes providing nice behaviour
in either direction.

<H3>SAI - DOM Integration</H3>

If you select to use the default factory for producing elements, then the
documents produced will guarantee that the SAI and DOM methods may be mixed.
It will allow a mixed mode operation such as this:

<PRE>
Element el = document.getElementById("MyTransformGroup");
TransformGroup tg = (TransformGroup)el;
tg.setTranslation(new Vector3Field(0, 1, 1));
</PRE>

Use of any other factory will not guarantee this behaviour.
