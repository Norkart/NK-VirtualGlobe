Implementation of a load manager and cache for externally referenced file
within a scene.
<P>

The load manager runs as a standalone handler for dealing with nodes in a
VRML scene that define their contents outside of the current file. Standard
implementation examples of this are Scripts, ImageTextures and Inlines.
<P>

The loader will produce a full cache and asynchronous loading mechanism for
content. The loader may be interrupted to remove all the currently loading
content of the scene. Caching is performed on the local machine if allowed.
Most of the behaviour can be controlled to optimise it for a given machine
and network connection.
<P>

To load all files, the handler makes use of Justin Couch's
<A HREF="http://www.vlc.com.au/urilib">URIlib</A> Java library for loading
URNs and URLs. The standard <CODE>java.net</CODE> library is not used as it
does not provide support for URNs that the universal media library needs. This
package contains a number of system properties so make sure that you check
and set these as well in order for this to function correctly.
<P>

This package uses the following system properties to modify its behaviour.
<UL>
<LI><CODE>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader.threads</CODE> The number of concurrent
    threads to be started to do loading.
</LI>

<LI><CODE>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader.sort_order</CODE> A space separated list
    containing one or more of the words <CODE>scripts</CODE>,
    <CODE>inlines</CODE>, <CODE>textures</CODE>, <CODE>externprotos</CODE>,
    <CODE>audio</CODE> and <CODE>others</CODE>. The declaration order is the
    sort order for values to be fetched within a given scene. Any values not
    declared are placed at the end of the list in any arbitrary order.
</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Configuring the Loader</H3>

The loader's behaviour can also be adjusted for different styles of work
depending on the needs of the application. All code is designed to allow
changing of the implementation so that experimentation may be performed.

<H4>Setting the loader type</H4>

<H4>URI resolution setup</H4>

The URI resolver library requires a few properties to work as required. We
do not set these internally as you may wish to override the defaults or
use factories rather than the properties.
<P>

Properties are used to configure the URI library about where to find handlers
for different networking protocols and interpretation of content into Java
objects. These allow you to turn raw bytes into something that the application
understands. Sun includes a number of default implementations of these, but
they are not particularly efficient or easy to use. We therefore allow you
to provide your own, or use the ones that come with the URI library.
<P>

There are two properties to set:
<CODE>uri.content.handler.pkgs</CODE> and
<CODE>uri.protocol.handler.pkgs</CODE>. The first property defines the list
of packages that are used to locate content handlers for things like images
and HTML files. The second property locates the packages to look for when
dealing with network protocol handlers. The value of these are a list of
package names separated by the pipe character '|' and point to the root
package name rather than the acutual packages. See the java.net package
documentation or URIlib documentation for more details.
<P>

If you are lazy, then this is all you need to set.

<PRE>
  System.setProperty("uri.content.handler.pkgs", "vlc.net.content");
  System.setProperty("uri.protocol.handler.pkgs", "vlc.net.protocol");
</PRE>

Note that if you need to handle Inline nodes, you will probably also want to
use the various factories in the {@link org.web3d.net.content} package too.
