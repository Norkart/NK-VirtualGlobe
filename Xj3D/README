                         Welcome to Xj3D codebase.

If you have arrived at this file as a result of directly downloading the CVS
archive, I'd suggest looking at the HowToInstall.html file.  This will
take you through getting the proper packages needed for installation and
compiling the codebase.

If you have arrived here through a pre-built installer for the binaries,
ignore the installation instructions.

This is a simple roadmap to the entire codebase as found in CVS:

Directory        Description
---------        -----------
apps             Standalone applications developed with Xj3D
bin              Convenience scripts.
contrib          Externally contributed code. Not maintained as part of
                 the mainline codebase.
docs             Documentation for this project
   arch          Architecture documentation about how the code is put together
   setup         Files that might make your personal setup easier
   javadoc       Automatically created when you want to create javadoc
examples         Small example projects
    browser      Examples of how to assemble a customised browser
                 using the internal APIs of Xj3D.
    loader       Examples of using Xj3D as a Java3D Loader
    sai          Examples showing how to use the X3D external SAI
lib              3rd-party libraries needed to compile and run Xj3D.
make             Support files used by make
parsetest        Files used to test all aspects of the system
spec_examples    Examples directly transcribed from the X3D specifications
src              Source code use to build Xj3D and associated applications,
                 such as the installers. Separate subdirectories by language.

Depending on how you got here, some of these directories may not be present
on your machine.
