A simple editor for X3D.  Mostly designed to test the DOM access to the 
scenegraph. 

Setup:
	For JDK's less then 1.4 you will need to copy jars/xj3d.jar to your ext
	directory(ex: jdk1.3.1/jre/lib/ext) or whereever JAXP is installed.

To use:
	java SEX3D

Other:
	The error reporting on this example is not very good in regards to 
	malformed documents.  The method convertDoc will fail cryptically.  I'd
	suggest using a validating editor like X3D-EDIT to confirm you have a 
	good file.
