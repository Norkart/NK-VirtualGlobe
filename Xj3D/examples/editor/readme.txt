     		   Simple Editor for X3D (SEX3D)
     
This demo application shows a simple-ish editor for playing with X3D documents.
As one of the more complex demostrations, it combines the custom parser, the
DOMtoJ3D convertor for rendering and the UI components. It serves as a great
illustration of the combination of all these pieces - how they may interact to
produce a full application.
