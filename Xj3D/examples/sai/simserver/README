This example shows how to use Xj3D as world simulation server.
A world is loaded that contains an autonomous underwater vehicle and
some moving objects in the way.  The robot has 3 whisker sensors
which detect whether an object is in the way of its travel.  It will
report whenever it hits something.  Smarter code might actually
do something about this problem instead of running them over!

To run:

In window 1:
   java PickServer
     use -visual to see the results

In window 2:
   java AUVController

AUVController.java - Sends control messages to the AUV.  Mimics receiving
real telemetry data from an AUV.  Also moves targets around randomly.  In
a real simulation this traffic would come from several sources.

PickerServer.java - Detects and reports whether the whiskers hit a target.
Loads pick_world.x3dv which describes the world the robot is in.  Also include
the LinePicker used to detect targets.
