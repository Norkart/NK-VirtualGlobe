Welcome to the documentation of the Xj3D codebase. Here you will find
(eventually) all the documentation about how the code is put together
and the hows and why of what this project is.
<P>

As a simple summary, Xj3D is the implementation of the
<A HREF="http://www.web3d.org/Specifications/VRML97/">VRML97 specification</A>
and an experimental implementation of the in-progress
<A HREF="http://www.web3d.org/x3d.html">X3D specification</A>
using the Java language and environment. In particular, it uses Java 3D
to provide the 3D graphics rendering layer. It serves a dual purpose of
being an experimental codebase for trying out new areas of the specification
and as a library that we encourage application developers to use within
their own application to support X3D technology.

<H3>Licensing</H3>

The core libraries implementing the parsing, rendering and user interface
components are under the GNU
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">LGPL</A>. All of the example
code and demo applications will be under the GNU
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GPL</A>. Anything that is not
in one of these two categories (such as this documentation) are undecided as
this point in time.
