<A NAME="intro">
<H2>Intro</H2>
</A>

As an alternative to DOM access, the <I>Scene Authoring Interface</I> is a
VRML native interface to the scenegraph.

<H3>Background</H3>

The SAI came from a wish to combine the old External Authoring Interface and
Scripting interface from the VRML97 specification and provide a single
programming interface for either internal or external programming. On top of
these capabilities there was a wish to provide strong typing for individual
node types. This has lead to an API set that is extensible for future profiles
as well as the current known profiles.
<P>

Since two different access methods are provided to a VRML scenegraph, there
needed to be some testing of the interfaces to make sure that there will be
no clashes of method signatures or different required implementations.

<H3>Motivation</H3>

The structure of this code is designed to allowed developers to include new
profiled nodes that are not included in the current implementation set. We
want to fit within the standard DOM implementation and still also provide
independent code.
<P>

Following the lead set by the specification we want to provide a combined
implementation of the DOM and SAI interfaces without any extra ties to the
rendering system. Although the intent of the SAI is to provide a highspeed,
efficient implementation, our intent is to test the SAI and DOM combination.
The result is that we can use the DOM interfaces and cast the code to either
interface as required. We can then pass this DOM information to any other
piece of code that requires a DOM tree and use either DOM or SAI to change
those values.

<A NAME="structure">
<H2>Structural Overview</H2>
</A>

The implementation classes follow the same rules as the sai interfaces as well
as using the factories provided by our <A HREF="dom.html">DOM</A>. The code
relies on the foundations provided by the DOM classes and then layers the
SAI code over the top.
<P>

<H3>Code Layout</H3>

Implmentation classes are based on 5 basic classes - the implementation of the
two factories and the SAI extensions of element and attributes. These basic
relationships are illustrated in Figure 1. The factories are responsible for
creating instances of the SAI classes that also provide the DOM classes.

<P>

The classes are arranged in packages that match the same packages as the SAI
interfaces. The top level package is in the <CODE>sai</CODE> package that
resides under the <CODE>org.web3d.x3d.jaxp.dom</CODE> package. Under the SAI
area we separate out into attribute and element packages. These packages
contain the implementation of the respective interfaces from the SAI. Under the
element package we have sub-packages that correspond to the profile names and
the interfaces defined therein.
<P>

The structure is relatively simple for this code. There is no complex
relationships. As you can see from Figure 1, the DOM Element implementation has
a reference to the <CODE>AttributeFactory</CODE> to create new attributes. This
is the most complex of all the implementation. The implication of this is that
we should always use the two factory implementations together. If we are
creating SAI elements, then we should also use SAI attributes.

<H3>Core Implementation</H3>

To provide the maximum benefits of extensibility both of the factories use a
dynamic class instantiation pattern. As you will see in Figure 1, there is no
direct relationship between the factories and the implementation classes. This
is due to this dynamic creation routine.

<H4>Attribute Creation</H4>

Creation of attributes is through <CODE>SAIAttributeFactory</CODE>. Within
X3D we have to deal with the same attribute name for different elements
resulting in different SAI classes needed. To cope with this and also the need
to be able to dynamically add new attributes we use a property system to
define the relationships without needing to recompile the code.
<P>

A property file is used to define the relationships between elements,
attributes and the SAI field types. On startup, we load the property file and
use that as the reference within the factory when creating new attributes.
When a request for an attribute is made, we ask for the tag name of the
element and combine this with the field name wanted. This is used to look up
the properties for the matching type name. Assuming a positive response we
create the name of the class as a string and then use reflection to create an
instance. The class created is then returned to the caller of the factory.

<H4>Element Creation</H4>

Creation of elements is through the <CODE>SAIElementFactory</CODE> class.
As we have a lot of different elements in many different profiles, most of
them we don't know at coding time. Like the attribute factory, we create
classes dynamically. We know the base package already. To this we query
the <CODE>ProfileInfo</CODE> for the loaded profiles and then loop through
the subpackages of these profiles looking for a class that matches the
tag name. Class names also append the word "Element" to the class. This is
added to allow dis-ambiguity in the class names and the interfaces they
implement.
<P>

Each class is layered over the top of the <CODE>X3DNode</CODE> implementation.
All information is handled by the node rather than any local handling in the
SAI code. Where attributes are used, these extend <CODE>X3DAttr</CODE> and
are set and fetched through the base class. For example, to ask for a
location attribute, the implementation asks the Node for the attribute named
by the "location" string. This is then cast to the SAI interface and returned
to the caller.
<P>

The impact of this is that it doesn't present the highest performance
implementation. However it allows us a simple check of how the SAI and DOM
work together. We also gain all the other benefits such as automatic DOM event
handling when we change attribute values etc.

<A NAME="extending">
<H2>Extending the Code</H2>
</A>

One of the most important goals of the Xj3D codebase is to provide easy
extensibility for the codebase to support trials of new node types and
profiles. We want to aid this as much as possible without the need to recompile
the core implementation classes.

<H3>New Fields</H3>

To add a new attribute type firstly determine if you want a new single or array
type. For single types, extend the class <CODE>BaseFieldAttr</CODE>, while
array types should extend <CODE>BaseFieldArrayAttr</CODE>. Provide appropriate
set and get methods.
<P>

Next edit the file <CODE>sai_attributes.props</CODE>. In here, add a definition
for the attribute type - defined by an element and field name. If you are using
this field type as the same attribute name in multiple elements then you can
use a pseudo-wildcard arrangement by replacing the <I>entire</I> element name
with a '*'.
<P>

Now re-start your code. Any element that uses this new field type will
automatically pick up the new implementation class and provide all of the
event handling and correct functionality.

<H3>New Nodes</H3>

A new node type is as simple as knowing what sort of VRML node type you want
to provide. There are a number of defined typing interfaces provided in the
<CODE>org.web3d.x3d.sai</CODE> package and for the vast majority of cases you
will be wanting to use these as they correspond to the Parameter Entity types
defined in the X3D DTD. Find the abstract class that implements this interface,
they can be found in the <CODE>org.web3d.x3d.jaxp.dom.sai.element</CODE>
package. If the class belongs to an existing profile, create your new class in
the directory/package that corresponds to that profile name. If you are making
a new profile then create a new sub directory to the element directory that
matches the profile name <I>that exactly matches the case</I>.
<P>

Write an implementation for your new node type. The name of the class should
match the node name type and also end in the word "Element". You are free to
implement the field handling however you like, however we strongly recommend
following the procedures used in the standard node types, which delegate the
handling to the base classes.
<P>

Compile your new node type. Now, start the application, and you should be
able to create new node instances immediately.
<P>

<B>Note:</B> We know of one security problem - if your Xj3D core classes are
installed in the jre/lib/ext directory then it will not find any classes that
are located in the classpath outside of this area. This is a standard
security measure by Java in order to stop hostile code being dynamically
loaded with the permissions of core classes. You may need to wrap your code
as a JAR file and put it in with the core classes.
