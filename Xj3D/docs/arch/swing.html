<A NAME="intro">
<H2>Intro</H2>
</A>

Apart from the basic representation of X3D structure, a lot of applications
require a user interface that also presents information on the scene graph.
Within Java, Swing is the standard interface that is used to provide this
user interface. This component provides a collection of classes that allow
you to view DOM, and hence X3D, content in a Swing based user interface.

<H3>Background</H3>

When first working on the X3D code, we needed to produce a number of example
applications that would show X3D content and how the Xj3D library was used.
Swing was the user interface for this. One of the standard systems that we
dealt with was a JTree as that heirarchical structure nicely reflects the DOM
structure. So, as we thought it would be useful to users of the codebase all
over, we decided to expend a little extra effort in building a complete JTree
implementation that would interact with the DOM.

<H3>Motivation</H3>

As the code was going to be publically used we wanted to make sure that it
functioned nicely. A simple hack was not going to be appropriate. The code
had to support the full capabilities of our implementation of the DOM. To
do this, we provided both static and dynamic aspects of the DOM specifications.
Also, as the user might only want parts of it, we decided to provide a full
range of options for swing pieces to be used.

<A NAME="structure">
<H2>Structural Overview</H2>
</A>

The current implementation code focusses on building a custom data model for
Swing's JTree class. We have not worked on any other part of Swing yet.
Everything is based around the <CODE>TreeModel</CODE> class from Swing. Also,
we make use of a few pieces from the Utils component to make life easier.

<H3>Code Layout</H3>

Our code is centered around the classes defined in Figure 1. The
<CODE>DOMTreeModel</CODE> is used to present swing our model of the tree
information. Unlike most other packages, this component does not contain any
private classes to do extra work. Everything is public, as it is all usable
in a public manner.

The tree model is responsible for creating and maintaining tree node instances.
This is so that swing can query it for new information about changes in the
underlying model. The <CODE>DOMTreeNode</CODE> represents a single node in
the tree for both DOM and Swing. It does not attempt to do anything except
hold data.
<P>

The cell renderer and editor classes are standalone. You may use these in any
tree that has DOM classes available. There is no direct relationship between
these classes and the tree model.

<H3>Core Implementation</H3>

The main point of interest is the <CODE>DOMTreeModel</CODE> class. This
provides the glue between the DOM tree and the Swing view of it. To do this,
it must be able to handle requests for new information and also keep up with
changes in the underlying DOM tree.
<P>

To maintain a watch on the DOM information, the tree model will attach itself
as a DOM Event listener if the Document says that it supports the feature
"DOMMutationEvents" of version 2.0 or greater. This looks for mutation events
for "DOMNodeInserted", "DOMNodeRemoved" and "DOMAttrModified".
<P>

Changes driven from the user interface end are only partially supported in the
current implementation. If the value of a node changes it will be reflected
in the DOM, but it does not support structural changes such as adding new
nodes. If you need to add new nodes to the tree then this should be through
the DOM methods directly.

<H3>Modifiable Nodes</H3>

Only certain parts of the DOM tree are editable as far as the user interface
is concerned. Some of this is linked to what we have so far implemented and
sometimes it just doesn't make sense. When editing nodes, we only change nodes
where the DOM says it is legal to change their value with
<CODE>setNodeValue()</CODE>.
<P>

In summary, the only nodes that we permit to be modified are:

<UL>
<LI>Attributes
<LI>Text
<LI>Comments
<LI>CDATA sections
</UL>

<H3>Node rendering</H3>

The <CODE>DOMTreeCellRenderer</CODE> provides the ability to render a node in
the tree. When it encounters an Element, it will ask the
<CODE>IconLoader</CODE> whether it has an icon for that element. If it does,
it is set. If there is no icon then it will just use the label describing the
node's name.
<P>

For all the other nodes, we only use text, but what is used for the text
changes over time. Attributes are rendered in the form
<PRE>
  <I>attribute_name</I>=<I>attribute_value</I>
</PRE>

Text, CDATA and comments are rendered as (using comment as an example):
<PRE>
  Comment "<I>comment_text</I>"
</PRE>

Document and document fragments are just rendered using their node names of
"Document" and "Document Fragment" directly. All other node types just use
the standard DOM node name (the one that has # in front).

<A NAME="runtime">
<H2>Runtime Semantics</H2>
</A>

Runtime changes in the code are based around listening for DOM events to
structural changes in the tree. When the DOM changes, we want to update the
screen. All changes in structure are driven by the DOM, but value changes at
a given node may also go from Swing back to DOM.

<H3>Adding and Removing Nodes</H3>

The process of adding a new node as described in Figure 2 starts with the
creation of a new node. Somewhere in userland code they ask the
<CODE>Document</CODE> to create a new node instance such as an element. Then
this is passed to the DOM model at the point where it should be inserted.

   addition of a new DOM node.
</CENTER>
<P>

If the DOM model supports DOM events (<A HREF="dom.html">our implementation</A>
does, but it is not guaranteed by other implementations such as the default
that comes with JAXP) this will trigger a mutation event. The mutation event
is received by the <CODE>DOMTreeModel</CODE>. This then builds a swing
representation of the tree node, adds it to the parent tree node and then
dispatches an event to Swing. One of the listeners for the event is the
<CODE>JTree</CODE> that the model instance belongs to. It then queries the
model for the tree node information, requests a renderer for that DOM element
and updates the on-screen representation. After this, the Swing listener
returns, allowing the DOM listener to return and we exit out of all the layers
until we arrive back at userland code.

<H3>Changing Attribute Values</H3>

To change the value of an attribute we may start with userland code or
through user interface based editing. Figure 3 illustrates the sequence of
events when user code changes a DOM value and figure 4 shows what happens when
the JTree editing capabilities are used.

   updating of an attribute node from the DOM perspective.
</CENTER>
<P>

This event flow is fairly simple. As the user changes an attribute value, it
fires a DOM event sequence. The tree, as a listener picks this up, finds the
tree node associated with it and creates a tree event. The JTree will then
query back for the value and update the screen.
<P>

For user interface events from the JTree, we use the capabilities of the
<CODE>CellEditor</CODE> interface. This is queried to see if the node is
editable (see above for details). If it is, an editor component is fetched,
filled with the appropriate values and then we wait for keyboard input. When
the input is an ENTER or ESC then we deliver an event to tell the system that
editing is finished (either complete or cancelled accordingly). This in turn
results with the tree making queries back to the editor to get the value and
then informing our tree model. Once the tree model has the update it passes
it through to the appropriate DOM value.

<A NAME="extending">
<H2>Extending the Code</H2>
</A>

The current code has no knowledge of X3D specific items. That is, the items in
the tree could come from any form of document.

<H3>New Element Types</H3>

If you only want to show new element types, there is nothing that needs to be
done. A new element, if an icon cannot be found for it, will appear as plain
text on the tree. If you would like an icon for it, all you need to do is
find the <CODE>images</CODE> directory in your CLASSPATH. In there, add a GIF
file that has the same name (including case) as the tag name of the element.
Next time that element appears in the tree it will use your new icon.
