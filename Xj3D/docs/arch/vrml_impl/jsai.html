<H2>Intro</H2>
</A>

This document describes the implementation of the VRML97 JSAI specification.

<H3>Background</H3>

The JSAI interface, being Java should theoretically be one of the easiest
interfaces for scripting to implement in an all Java browser. As always
happens, this is not the case. Due to the design of the public API the ability
to cleanly implement this code has been a major struggle. In the end we found
it was all but impossible to do without at least adding a few methods to the
basic interface or changing the class heirarchy from that defined in the
specification in some way.

<H3>Motivation</H3>

One of the goals of the Xj3D project is to allow as many different scripting
implementations as possible. We still have to start somewhere to test our
theories and the JSAI implementation is it. Thus, there is a lot of work here
that may get revised at some time in the future as we gain more experience
dealing with other APIs and scripting engine implementations.
<P>

In this code we look to try to unravel the dependency problems as much as
possible while providing a good level of performance that fits within the
over-arching architecture. It has lead to a little bit of extra code that
could be eliminated on performance grounds, but would heavily impact on
design cleanliness.

<A NAME="structure">
<H2>Structural Overview</H2>
</A>

The code is split all over the place. Apart from the basic classes in the
<CODE>vrml</CODE>, <CODE>vrml.node</CODE> and <CODE>vrml.field</CODE> packages,
there is also a further basic package that contains the generic scripting
engine implementation and a few support classes that are renderer specific and
extend the classes provided by the specification.
<P>

Unfortunately, the design of the specification API is not as clean as it should
be (I have only myself to blame as I was heavily involved in that process!).
There are many circular dependencies between classes both in the same
package and across packages. To avoid any more problems, we have eliminated any
further circular dependencies between the specification classes and our
implementation of them. Thus, there is a one way dependency graph that can be
traced from the core interfaces to specification classes to wrapper classes.
This does lead to some rather odd looking structures, but it really was the
only way that we could keep the compilation process sane.

<H3>Code Layout</H3>

In implementing the design, we have a collection of classes that are spread
all over the place, as you can see in Figure 1. However, we separate the code
into three functional blobs:

<UL>
<LI>VRML97 JSAI specification classes <CODE>vrml.*</CODE></LI>
<LI>Classes that load a script instance and prepare it for action</LI>
<LI>Classes that provide interaction with a running script</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Design Process</H4>

Due to the nature of the specification classes, coming up with what is a
reasonable design is a rather interesting task. There are a number of possible
alternatives, which we will outline here. The reason for this is that the
design we've come up with here might not seem to be the most logical. In
particular, future maintainers and developers of the codebase may be wondering
why we have done things in the way we have. It was hard enough designing the
system in the first place, let alone understanding why we did things like this
a couple of years down the track!
<P>

The basic problem we have to solve is that there is a user class
<CODE>Script</CODE> that is extended by the user to provide working code.
In this class they can access fields and events of the script. Once you have
access to a field, you can potentially have access to other nodes. You can
then create new node children for a field, including passing in your local
script reference as well (multiple parenting of the script programmatically!).
On top of this, users are free to create their own instances of the field
classes such as <CODE>vrml.field.SFInt32</CODE>. These classes we have no
control over until they get passed to our runtime code, so we have to be able
to deal with arbitrary data too.
<P>

In our design, the process started by looking at what would happen and the
script end, designing for that, and then moving back out along chain of action
that a user might use in a script. Therefore the design is based around the
script class being the central action item and all activities are based around
how a user moves from script interaction to using other nodes.
<P>

Usually the first thing a user does in a script is to ask for the various
fields in a script and possibly read their value(s). Typically this is done in
the <code>initialize()</code> method so everything must be available by that
time. These services mean that we must have provided the script instance with
a way of describing the fields that it contains beforehand, as well as a valid
<code>Browser</code> reference.
<P>

The field classes that represent the script's fields, must be live values.
Any changes here should be available to the outside world. As we have this
problem were users could create their own instances of the
<code>vrml.field</code> classes, that means we either place in extra methods
to the specification classes, or we provide a wrapper. The former is quicker
to implement but means playing with the public interface (remember that the
scripting engine will be accessing the field classes from outside their own
package). The latter requires a lot of extra code, but provides other
advantages, such as being able to know exactly when changes happen in user code
(eg writing to an eventOut of the script).
<P>

Once we have the script having fields accessible, we have to then look at the
specific case of the script having an SFNode or MFNode field. These give user
code access to further node instances. These nodes can then be trawled for
fields, which may in turn contain further nodes and so on. This leads us to
needing to handle this process of creating new field representations for nodes
that are not the script and in particular dealing with dynamic scene graphs
that change over time.
<P>

Finally, the design must take into account the ability to use the
<code>browser</code> class to create new nodes as well as add and remove nodes.
This must connect the scripting engine back to the core of the runtime system
and must be renderer specific.

<H4>Mapping VRML97 to VRML200x</H4>

As the VRML200x specification is not complete and there is a lot of existing
code that uses the JSAI classes, we should be capable of running VRML97 scripts
in a file that has been converted to VRML200x. This ability involves a lot more
than you probably realised. At the simplest level, there is no more distinction
between field access. Gone are eventIn, eventOut etc, everything is just an
exposedField equivalent. There are also other behavioural changes such as the
event model execution and many new field types.
<P>

Under the current implementation we provide absolutely minimal protection
against the script doing the wrong thing. That is, where a VRML97 browser might
throw an exception we just ignore it and provide the direct field reference and
allow all updates through. A more sophisticate model needs to be implemented,
but we have not yet done this work.

<H3>VRML Specification classes</H3>

The classes that provide the requirements specified in the VRML97 specification
are in the usual location. There are not extra classes added, only a few extra
methods and fields that make life easier for us.
<P>

<H4>Fields</H4>

Starting with the fields, that are based on the <code>vrml.Field</code> class,
these will be used to build access to basic field information. The base classes
only add one variable - the timestamp of when the field was last changed.
Each of the individaual field type classes handle their own data types.
Interally fields that take arrays of values store them as a flat 1D array of
values. Any time the user sets values as a 2D array this is flattened to be a
single 1D array. This keeps us in line with the convention of the rest of the
VRML core that passes only flat arrays internally. It results in the minimal
amount of data shuffling.
<P>

As the user can create their own instances of these classes, they have no
connection to the core browser implementation. Even the SFNode fields do not
have connections with the underlying core field as these simple classes do not
have any relationship with them.

<H4>Node representations</H4>

The basic node representation adds a couple of protected fields and also an
extra public method that allows access to the underlying core node type. The
reason for this extra method is that we need access to the basic core node
representation whenever the user tries to manipulate the nodes.
<p>

The reason for adding an extra public method here is that both the script and
derived node representation need this information. It was simpler to add a
single method in the common <code>BaseNode</code> method than having them
distributed across a number of classes. We assume that if you have a valid node
instance it has to have come from something that is already creating a valid
<code>BaseNode</code> instance such as one of the browser createX methods. It
is not possible to get an instance any other way. From the internals
perspective, whenever we need to access the core node representation, it is
much easier to just call the method directly rather than perform a collection
of <code>instanceof</code> calls with casts - it also means that
<code>Script</code> would need the method added at a public level any way.
<p>

One design question that is raised at a time like this - why not build a common
base class that hides the public methods into something local. We could do
that, but to do it effectively means the methods should be in a package private
access for the scripting engine. With the way the build environment is made, and
also just for pure good design reasons, it is a bad idea to have to compile one
class in one package, then compile another package and then come back to the
original package. Another alternative is to put the new base class in a
separate package, but why have a package for one class?

<H4>Browser Representation</H4>

Capabilities to create new nodes and control the browser is performed through
the <code>Browser</code> class. The implementation here does nothing other than
provide default implementations of all the required methods. As the browser
handling is very dependent on the renderer used, we assume that each renderer
will create their own derived instance of the browser class that overrides all
of the methods.
