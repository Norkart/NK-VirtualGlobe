<A NAME="intro">
<H2>Intro</H2>
</A>

This document describes how the Xj3D codebase handles scripts. Scripts are
an extremely important part of the runtime environment and they are also the
most complex part of the specification to implement. Scripts reach into almost
every aspect of the system.

<H3>Background</H3>

One of the two early motivators for the current Xj3D design and development was
to build a codebase that allowed for experimentation with the next generation
of coding interfaces. There was quite a bit of interest in making sure that the
next generation specification used a common set of classes for both internal
(scripting) and external (EAI) coders. This causes all sorts of other
interesting problems - such as deciding at runtime which version of the
specification a script belonged to. Basically, you can't tell until the script
is actually loaded or parsed.

<H3>Motivation</H3>

Since we had to build for two different languages, and two different versions
for both those languages, the design might as well become generic and allow any
language to be plugged in. Thus, the design also had to suit a number of
different application types, as well as the need to be as efficient as possible.
<P>

An important motivator in the design is to maintain the independence of the
scripting implementation from the renderer. A scripting engine should be able
to run in any renderer implementation, just as much as a renderer can use any
script engine without knowing what language is being used.

<A NAME="structure">
<H2>Structural Overview</H2>
</A>

As mentioned earlier, code is spread all over the place. Even the main code for
loading scripts and their engines is spread across a number of packages that
don't lie in a nice neat hierarchy.

<H3>Code Layout</H3>

Code can be broken into three main parts:
<UL>
<LI>Interfaces to describe a generic scripting engine</LI>
<LI>Management code to load and initialise scripts</LI>
<LI>Runtime management of scripts within the event model</LI>
</UL>

The one key part that we leave out of this discussion is the implementation
of language specific handling. That is left to the individual documents for
each language.
<P>

Figure 1 shows the basic layout of the public classes involved in this
process. There are other, package-private classes, but these are not important
to this discussion. As you can see, the two main packages that are of
interest are <CODE>org.web3d.vrml.scripting</CODE> and
<CODE>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader</CODE>.

<H3>Scene graph node representation</H3>

Like all other nodes that are read from a stream, we need to provide a
representation within the scene graph. All scene graph nodes are
represented by the <CODE>VRMLNodeType</CODE> interface. Extended from this is
the <CODE>VRMLScriptNodeType</CODE> interface that all scripts use. Scripts
also pick up the <CODE>VRMLExternalNodeType</CODE> secondary capability to
indicate that the node has content loaded from an external source.
<P>

Script nodes, although on the surface having the same fields as an inline or
image texture node, acts quite differently. Where an inline directly uses the
content it registers, a script must add a couple of extra layers, such as a
runtime engine. While it is possible for the script to be given the raw
Java class or text for ecmascript, this eliminates a number of other
possibilities, such as dealing with classes that do not load correctly and
therefore moving onto the next choice.
<P>

When loading scripts, we want to separate them from the normal external node
loading process. The normal <CODE>ExternalLoadManager</CODE> will ignore
loading scripts so that our separate process can look after the intracacies
of dealing with the scripting engines.


<H3>Scripting Language Support</H3>

Supporting multiple languages means that there are a variety of ways that
a particular language may wish to operate, with regard to the script execution.
The way that the implementation is structured is to maintain the distinction
between the language handling and an instance of one script using that
language, in the scene graph.
<P>

Distinction between the two parts is by using two interfaces to represent the
different responsibilites. We term the language "interpreter" as an engine,
while the code for a particular script node is handled by a wrapper that
contains all of the context information.

<H4>Scripting Engine</H4>

Scripting engines support the language and any runtime interpretation that is
needed. For example, a Javascript interpreter has an interpretor that is called
whenever a script is executed. It is really inefficient to keep a complete
instance of the interpreter for each script instance, so the engine acts as a
single, shared resource.
<P>

Engines are represented by the <CODE>ScriptEngine</CODE> interface. Each
language takes this interface and implements it accordingly. The role of the
interface is to present to the runtime environment a basic set of capabilities.
<P>

Firstly it nominates the type of MIME types that it supports for content. For
example, a Java engine supports <CODE>application/x-java</CODE> where an
ECMAScript engine supports <CODE>application/ecmascript</CODE>. This allows
the load process to select the appropriate engine for the language described
by the URL. It also allows an engine to support more than one MIME type. For
example, a single engine may be able to support ECMAScript, Javascript and
VRMLScript all at once.
<P>

The second role of the engine interface is to create a runtime handler for
the script's executable code. The idea is that it creates and instance of
the wrapper interface and then all of the execution details are hidden behind
that wrapper. Whether the engine uses a shared interpreter or one instance per
script, we don't know and don't care.

<H4>Script Wrappers</H4>

In abstraction the script execution in this way, we are left with the gap
between what the scripting specification says, and what the runtime node
wants (represented by the <CODE>VRMLScriptNodeType</CODE> interface.
<P>

The wrapper interface, represented by <CODE>ScriptWrapper</CODE> is used to
represent all of the activities that a scene graph node needs to do in order
to conform to the VRML specification. That is, the public interface that is
presented to the scene graph is not the same set of capabilities that the
script needs internally to process received events, which is again different
to the actual executing script code itself.
<P>

In designing the wrapper, we had to be really careful to make sure that all
of the right items were covered both for now and in the future. For example,
the script needs to be initialised somehow, and the script code needs to access
the real field information. At the same time, we need to subject ourselves to
the scripting model where it is possible to buffer events before sending them
to the script code. Although some language implementations may not like this,
we still need to provide the capabilities for those that don't. Better too
much capability than two little - particularly as we are trying to be
experimental as well.

<H3>Script Loading Infrastructure</H3>

Looking after the script loading is the job of the classes in the
<CODE>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader</CODE> package. The main class that you
work with here is the <CODE>ScriptLoader</CODE>, which performs a similar
task to the <CODE>ExternalLoadManager</CODE> for other nodes.
<P>

Loading of scripts, like other external nodes is an asynchronous matter. After
registering nodes with the loader, the application returns to whatever other
process is happening. Scripts, as they gain their files are then initialized
as required, internally by the system (the runtime description of this process
is presented below).
<P>

The script loader does not automatically find any script engines. It is the
job of the application that is putting together the various components to
locate and register script engines. We've taken this approach because a
developer may want to provide external implementations, or test their code
using a particular language, rather than the first one that takes. What this
does is allow them to control which engines shall be available at any given
time (for example, from a user interface that enables and disables them).
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note. The script loading process does not use an abstract interface style
representation like route and file loader management does. That is one
possibility, but we have decided whether it is worth the effort currently.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Script Runtime Structure</H3>

Once the script is loaded, the scene graph needs to do some work with all the
event routing. Ensuring that events get into and out of the script code is a
collaboration between three classes - the implementation of
<CODE>VRMLScriptNodeType</CODE>, the language implementation of
<CODE>ScriptWrapper</CODE> and the <CODE>RouteManager</CODE> implementation.
<P>

Starting at the top, the route manager is responsible for making sure that
events make it to the scene graph node in the first place. It is also
responsible for making sure that events generated by the script make it back
out to the normal scene graph. It must also ensure that the post-event
processing method <CODE>eventsProcessed()</CODE> gets called at the right time,
requiring scripts to be registered separately within the route manager.
<P>

Once the event reaches the scene graph node, the node is the responsible for
dealing with local management issues like queuing them up in the script wrapper
and dealing with all the other method calls - in particular, dealing with any
error conditions that may have been generated by the script's executable code.
<P>

Running code in the interpreter requires collating all of the input from the
scene graph and then passing it through the interpreter. Of course, making
sure that everything works correctly is the devil of the details. For a Java
based script - that's easy, just call the right method. For interpreted
scripting language, that's where the fun starts.
<P>

Like the load manager keeps a reference to the cache to find files in, the
script loader keeps a reference to the collection of engines that are
registered for its instance. We do this, because it is possible that you may
want to create two browsers in the same VM instance that have different
scripting engines registered. This is a test for example to compare performance
of a ecmascript script versus one in Java. It is extremely important to keep
this context information with each script. Just as a load manager is global
for all files in a VM, so is the script loader. Those same conditions apply.

<P>
<HR>

<A NAME="runtime">
<H2>Runtime Semantics</H2>
</A>

At runtime, there are three basic processes that the scripting system must
perform: loading the script, pushing events to the script code and then dealing
with any events received.

<H3>Loading a Script</H3>

Loading a new script into the system is the biggest task of the scripting
system at runtime. This process not only requires you to load the raw bytes
of the script (which may actually be inlined in the VRML file), but also make
sure that there is an interpreter for it and that the interpreter is getting
the things it expected it was getting. If that is not enough, then the code
also needs to make sure that the script has all of the right hooks into the
runtime environment as well. The browser interface with methods like
<CODE>createVrmlFromString</CODE> really require an awful lot of capabilities
that cannot be simple deduced from the surround contexts.
<P>

The loading process starts by being informed of a new script that has not yet
been initialized - in this case the "User code" actor in Figure 2. The
script loader queues the script node for loading and then returns. At the point
where the script is taken from the queue and load process starts, that is when
the fun begins. As the figure points out, there is a lot of back and forth
shuffling of methods and nodes.

<B>Figure 2:</B> UML sequence diagram of the load process
</CENTER>
<P>

This back and forth convoluted path is designed to show the basic steps of
how the processing is done. In reality, the code is even messier than produced
here. For example, we can load all script types except for Java scripts. Any
Java script must go through a different path in order to get the actual class
instance. This is due to the way that ClassLoaders work. It is not possible to
create a class loader and have it take any arbitrary stream of bytes that then
gives us a <CODE>Class</CODE> in return. Instead, we use the pre-packaged
<CODE>java.net.URLClassLoader</CODE> to do the dirty work. This all, of course,
requires some special case handling within the code that is not represented in
Figure 2.
<P>

An interesting issue to deal with is how scripts and, more importantly,
external code interacts with the live nodes of the scene. These pose some
interesting issues on node loading. Under the current implementation, we are
not sure that we have covered all the issues yet, but as a start, a script is
never reloaded once it has already attempted to load.

<H3>Processing incoming events</H3>

Scripts within the event cascade go through the three interacting classes.
Let's start by assuming that there is an event cascade already underway, as
shown in Figure 3. One or more updates find themselves arriving at the script's
scene graph representation node. After determining that the index is for a
valid node, the script then passes the value into the script wrapper through
one of the <CODE>queueEvent()</CODE> methods.

<P>

<IMG SRC="script_cascade_sequence_small.png" WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="205"></A><BR>
<B>Figure 3:</B> UML sequence diagram of the script in an event cascade
</CENTER>
<P>

At this point in time, the events are being queued still within our
implementation code and have not yet reached the user's script code. For
scripting engine implementations that don't want to queue events, they can
call the <CODE>processEvent</CODE> method immediately and then follow it with
a called to <CODE>eventsProcessed()</CODE>.
<P>

Once the route manager has determined that there are no further events cascades
to process, it will instruct the script node that the cascade has completed.
This in turn passes the notification to the wrapper through its
<CODE>sendEvents()</CODE> method. The engine then calls
<CODE>processEvents()</CODE> on the script followed by
<CODE>eventsProcessed()</CODE>. When this set of calls returns to the route
manager, it once again checks the output of the script to see if there are
any events that need routing and begins another cascade if there is.

There is only one way of extending this code - providing a new scripting
engine. This starts with by implementing the <CODE>ScriptEngine</CODE>
