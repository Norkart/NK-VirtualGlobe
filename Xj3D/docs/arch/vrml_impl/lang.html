<A NAME="intro">
<H2>Intro</H2>
</A>

The core package provides classes and interfaces that represent the common
functionality used by all the VRML code. Currently this is mainly exceptions
that pass error information about a caller providing invalid information for
fields and nodes within a VRML file.


<H3>Background</H3>

Regardless of where we are in VRML, we need to represent the core concepts of
what the <A HREF="../vrml/abstract_model.html">abstract data model</A> provides
us. As we were developing the code, it became more and more clear that a
separate package was needed to contain this very basic functionality that was
used everywhere. By rights, it did not belong within any other package as we
didn't want to have to pull in all the other functionality associated with that
package. It made sense to extract this common information and represent it as
a separate package.

<H3>Motivation</H3>

We have two classes of information that needs to be presented - file basic
structural information and errors. Therefore we created a <CODE>lang</CODE>
package to represent the absolute core of the VRML language and its underlying
data model. In essence, this represents the realisation of the concepts
presented within main abstract model (Figure 1 in the Abstract Data Model
document).
<P>

We already had a bunch of common errors that could occur anywhere within the
code. These errors could occur during parsing, during node creation and also
during runtime. As such, these errors didn't belong in a specific area, for
example, why should runtime code know or have to include the parsing
structures just to use the exceptions. Ideally we should be able to extract
runtime information and use it completely independently of the parser. Hence,
all the common errors that could occur in a VRML context are here.

<A NAME="structure">
<H2>Structural Overview</H2>
</A>

The lang package consists of a single package. There are no sub-packages.
The main aim of these classes and exceptions are to be used by other packages.

<H3>Code Layout</H3>

Figure 1 shows that there are two major structures of the code: There are the
classes that represent node structural information and the exceptions for
error conditions. Although there is no direct relationship between the two
parts, there is an implied one from the exceptions to the classes. If an
class generates an error for a field, it would be nice to know what field
was effected beyond more than just a simple text message.

<H3>Field Representation</H3>

All the information about a given field is held in the
<CODE>VRMLFieldDeclaration</CODE> class. This class represents the information
that describes a field rather than the field itself. That is, it does not store
the value of the field, just the description of it - the name, access type and
data type it represents.
<P>

The design makes the distinction between a field type description and the field
value for efficiency reasons. We find that it is rare that someone will need
the full field declaration when interacting with a VRML scene. However, they
need the field values very often. If we were to pass around the full set of
declarations and values, we would be wasting a lot of memory. By separating
the declaration information from the value, we need to maintain only one
instance of the declaration in memory regardless of the number of instances
of a given node. The node instance can then contain its own references to the
data values.
<P>

Refering to a given field is done through an integer value. Again, this design
decision is based on efficiency. Using an int primitive type allows fast
lookups of values rather than expensive class instance comparisons or string
compares for field names. It also allows us a lot of flexibility to handle
different names for the same field. For example, VRML97 allows exposedFields
to be known by 3 different names <I>fieldName</I>, <I>set_fieldName</I> and
<I>fieldName_changed</I>. By using an integer identifier, all of these
different names can be simply matched to a single field reference internally.
Similarly, we may use different names over time. As the VRML 200x specification
is evolving, names of fields may change even though the data remains the same.
One instance is the changing of the level field of LOD in VRML97 to the
children field of VRML200x. As our file reader and scenegraph may have to deal
with mixed content, this allows us a single representation of the node and
field contents regardless of the specification version.

<H3>Node Representation</H3>

Every node is represented by the basic <CODE>VRMLNode</CODE> interface. At
this level, the representation is very simple - it allows the user to query
the node for the index of a given field name, and then with the index to get
declaration information if so desired. We do not offer any more functionality
than this at such a low level as we never know what a user may want to do with
that node. Therefore we opt for the minimum required interface to query for
the node and its information. We don't even allow access to the scenegraph
structure at this point (ie parent or child nodes) as that then implies too
much about a particular representation of a node.
<P>

Node template representation is also provided at the lowest level. Templates
allow for a node to be defined on the fly from other information. These are
typically used to collect a group of functionality together and use it as a
single node. In the VRML97 specification, this was often used to define whole
collections of the specification such an humanoid or geographical information.
We provide this low level template because with the VRML200x specification,
these templates may translate to known internal nodes that are actually
instances of <CODE>VRMLNode</CODE>.

<A NAME="runtime">
<H2>Runtime Semantics</H2>
</A>

These classes define static structures and interfaces only. There is no
runtime information associated with their use above the normal Java language
semantics of exceptions. All exceptions defined here are standard
<CODE>java.lang.Exception</CODE> instances.	We do not use
<CODE>RuntimeException</CODE> anywhere in the codebase as we want to make
sure error conditions are explicitly caught. Any time that an error occurs it
could completely disrupt the runtime system. Allowing runtime exceptions
allows for the possibility of an uncaught exception completely halting the
rendering system - not a desirable trait. Therefore, we force on the programmer
the requirement to explicitly catch all error conditions all the time so that
any errors that stop the renderer are not our problem, but the implementor's.

<P>
<HR>

<A NAME="extending">
<H2>Extending the Code</H2>
</A>

Extending the package's functionality follows the same lines as the basic
structural information. - the exceptions provided, and the node
representations.

<H3>Exceptions</H3>

Exceptions may be extended to provide more precise information on the nature
of the error. In general, it is recommended that the more derived exceptions
be extended. However, for some cases, like parsing, a whole new classification
of exceptions can be generated, and these should extend the base
<CODE>VRMLException</CODE> class.

<H3>Classes</H3>

Here we have a mixed bag. Some classes are designed to be extended, others are
not.
<P>

The <CODE>VRMLFieldDeclaration</CODE> class is not designed to be extended.
Field representation information does not change and therefore the declaration
of a field should not change. If you need to provide for new field types, then
the place to look is the <CODE>FieldConstants</CODE> utility class. Here you
can add new definitions of field types (eg SFMyFieldType).
<P>

On the other hand, <CODE>VRMLNode</CODE> and <CODE>VRMLNodeTemplate</CODE>
cannot be used directly and must be extended to be used. However, we don't
expect users to be extending these nodes directly. Already the majority of the
required functionality is presented in the <A HREF="nodes.html">nodes</A>
package and we expect you to extend those interfaces only.
