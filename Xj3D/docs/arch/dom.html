<A NAME="intro">
<H2>Intro</H2>
</A>

Part of the VRML 3.0 specification is an XML encoding of the VRML core
behaviours. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a view of this XML information
once it has been loaded into the browser. If there is XML then the users will
usually expect to see a DOM representation of this structure so they can
access it as they need from external code. This component provides an
implementation of the DOM.

<H3>Background</H3>

The DOM representation is specificied by a number of W3C recommendations that
exist as seperately implementable modules. For each module, there is a set of
levels that provide an increasingly large set of capabilities. The current
capability levels are
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>0</TD><TD>Original Javascript style access - HTML only</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1</TD><TD>Static structure representation of a document</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2</TD><TD>Introduced namespace aware capabilities</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3</TD><TD>(In progress)Ability to get exact structure as defined in the file</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>

As DOM Level 3 is still experimental, the codebase has decided to pursue the
more stable and widely supported Level 2 interfaces.
<P>

Until mid 2000 there was no real generic way of building a DOM tree in Java
code. You could make use of a given library, but that also assumed that you
would have to install that on every machine. Along comes the XML folks and
they have defined a specification call the Java API for XML Processing - JAXP.
This allows you to fetch a parser without needing to know a specific
implementation class. The XML parsing code was now portable.

<H3>Motivation</H3>

Although the parsing code was portable, all of the implementations didn't
provide all of the specifications that we wanted. It would provide Level 2 Core
representation, but for X3D that was not sufficient. One of the ideas of the
DOM was to provide EAI type capabilities such as listening for event
information on any given scenegraph node. This information is supported by the
DOM Level 2 Events capabilities. So, to provide what we needed, we had to make
our own implementation that provided DOM event mechanisms.
<P>

A separate reason for needing to implement the DOM was for experimental
reasons. The new SAI specification was also providing a combination of DOM and
SAI interfaces merged together. Although we could test a certain level of
compatibility, it was not until we provided a complete implementation that we
would know for certain that the merging would work. None of the existing
parser implementations allowed us enough flexibility to get in and do this
customisation and testing to the extent needed.
<P>

The design of the code used in our DOM implementation is designed to be
extensible within the goals of the X3D system. That is, the implementation
itself should not be inherently coupled to X3D. An example of this is that we
might want to use MathML as a script to drive the X3D content. We may need to
have an external engine or representation of MathML and thus would like to use
out DOM implementation to represent that in a legal way too.
<P>

<HR>

<A NAME="structure">
<H2>Structural Overview</H2>
</A>

To implement a full DOM tree within Java, we looked to the JAXP specification
for influence. This provides a factory class to bootstrap our parser into
existance and then just returns instances of either the SAX or DOM interfaces.
At the same time, we wanted to allow for extension, but provide the core set
of capabilities such as events without the need to implement it by the
extenders. Our implementation is focused around doing this in as seemless a
way as possible.
<P>

In order to provide this seemless interaction, we needed to place all of the
classes in a single Java package. This package is called
<CODE>org.web3d.x3d.jaxp.dom</CODE> and is the central item in Figure 1.
Although it was possible to implement it in multiple packages, we wanted to
use the data hiding capabilities to reduce the amount of access that the
extenders could get to the implementation. We didn't want them to know or be
able to access things like changing the owner document for example. We've
only exposed the pieces needed to provide extensions to the node types.

<P>

<IMG SRC="dom_structure_small.png" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="206"></A><BR>
<B>Figure 1:</B> UML Structure diagram of the DOM implementation
</CENTER>
<P>

The complete implementation of the DOM structure is not shown in Figure 1.
What you have here is a listing of the pertinent classes for any person wishing
to extend the current capabilities. It doesn't really matter what the name of
the class is that implements the <CODE>DocumentType</CODE> interface.

<H3>Code Layout</H3>

As you can see from Figure 1, there are a number of packages that are provided
by external entities. The only two provided by this implementation is the
<CODE>jaxp</CODE> and <CODE>jaxp.dom</CODE>. The rest of the packages come from
external sources.
<P>

The package <CODE>org.w3c.dom</CODE> contains the interfaces
that specify the DOM Core capabilities. For the event handling we extend the
interfaces in <CODE>org.w3c.dom.events</CODE>. In the current implementation,
our code only provides <CODE>MutationEvents</CODE> as capabilities. This is
the basic modification of the scenegraph event. Other event types are not
supported in the default implementation because it does not make sense to do
so. If the tree is a static structure in memory on a server, is it worth
providing UI events?
<P>

Within the package code is broken into two functional groups - Parts providing
DOM structure support and event handling support. Classes providing structure
support start with the name <CODE><I>X3D</I></CODE> where classes providing
event support start with <CODE><I>DOM</I></CODE>.

<H3>Core Implementation</H3>

Reading through the DOM Core specification, the majority of the functionality
is based around two classes - <CODE>Node</CODE> and <CODE>Element</CODE>.
Correspondingly, the majority of the work and implementation code can be found
in our two implementation classes of <CODE>X3DNode</CODE> and
<CODE>X3DElement</CODE>.
<P>

<CODE>X3DNode</CODE> is responsible for the basic management of a given node
and all it's sub children. The implementation is fairly straight forward. It
has a number of data structures that keep lists of children and basic
attribute information. At the base class level it enforces all of the
requirements of the <CODE>Node</CODE> interface. If a derived class needs to
provide a different implementation then they are required to override the
appropriate method.
<P>
The need to override a method to provide different behaviour is a deliberate
design decision. This forces extenders to understand exactly what behaviour
they need to provide and check the specification for the right actions.
<P>

Event handling is also an important issue. The DOM Level 2 Events specification
recommends that the class that implements <CODE>Node</CODE> should also
implement the <CODE>EventTarget</CODE> interface. As our implementation does
provide event handling, we have followed this recommendation. All of the
management code for the child node handling also includes the necessary
functionality to deal with events. The details of how that works is not covered
here, but is in the Event Implementation section later.

<CODE>X3DElement</CODE> is the other class with a lot of functionality in it.
Here you will find all the handling for attributes.	The code is fairly
straight-forward here. All of the attribute handling is delegated off to the
<CODE>X3DNamedNodeMap</CODE> (an implementation of the DOM
<CODE>NamedNodeMap</CODE>). All the code is left to do is handle the right
event processing and keep local variables correctly set.
<P>

A requirement of the DOM is that if there is a default value for an attribute
and that attribute is not specified in the file, the DOM implementation must
make sure that it is available as a real value instance. In order to provide
this behaviour, we make use of the <CODE>ProfileInfo</CODE> class. This class
gives us a map of all the default attributes for a given node instance. (
how this is done is covered in the DOM Building section). Inside our element
implementation, we keep track of the adds and removes of attributes and
ensure that we stay consistent with the spec. This is the one area that we
do not delegate attribute handling to the NamedNodeMap and do it ourselves.

<H3>Event Implementation</H3>

DOM Events are quite a complex idea to implement. Unlike a standard listener
pattern, events within the DOM also travel outside of the object that generated
them. Events at a given level may travel up the tree to the parent nodes of
"this" node (bubbling) and also may filter down to the children (cancelable).
At any level, any node or listener may prevent the event from going any
further. From a pure performance perspective, this can have a real impact.
While the ideas are fine for slow time systems like a web page, the idea of a
clock running at a couple of hundred hertz with one event for every tick can
be quite a nightmare.
<P>

The current event implementation attempts to make a first pass at efficient
handling. There are many ways of making this run faster, but we first needed
to prove that we could implement it. The classes involved in DOM event handling
and propogation are described in Figure 2. This figure also makes reference to
the DOM interfaces that are required to be supported for the event module.

<P>

<B>Figure 2:</B> UML Structure classes involved in the implementation of
   DOM Events.
</CENTER>
<P>

At the centre of the system is the <CODE>X3DNode</CODE> class. This acts as
the hub for event management. It Has a reference to the class that generates
event instances (<CODE>X3DDOMEventGenerator</CODE>), a class that handles
events propogation (<CODE>DOMEventHandler</CODE>) and a class that holds meta
information for event propogation (<CODE>NodePath</CODE>).
<P>

As was stated earlier, <CODE>X3DNode</CODE> is responsible for managing all
the children nodes and delegates all of the event propogation information to
other classes. This keeps the implementation of each class relatively small
and allows us to swap various parts without effecting the overall codebase.
<P>

For events that are required to bubble, implementing them is relatively simple.
For each node, dispatch events at that level, then ask for the parent and
dispatch events on the parent etc until we reach the top of the tree. For
capture events, we have a different problem. The spec says that when an event
enters the tree, it must follow the direct path to the target node. We can't
just do a breadth first propogation of all child nodes until we find the
desired node. This means we need some prior knowledge of where the event is
meant to go and the path to get there. A second interesting problem that we
must also deal with is that if the tree changes on us while we are propogating
the event, the event must propogate through the original path at the time it
was first dispatched. Therefore we must capture the tree's exact path at the
time the event was propogated and not dynamically discover it as we are doing
the propogation.
<P>

To solve both of these problems, we use the <CODE>NodePath</CODE> class to
capture all path information to the node. This class captures the path
information at the time it was created and cannot be changed. There are a
number of advantages of this approach:
<UL>
<LI>All path information captured in a single place that doesn't change, as
    per the event spec
<LI>A one time hit for path discovery at the time the node is added/removed
    from the DOM tree rather than each time that an event is dispatched.
<LI>Ability to provide path optimisation to eliminate dead nodes that don't
    need to dispatch events because there are no listeners attached.
<LI>Segregation of event path information from the node handling allowing
    efficient construction capabilities.
</UL>

<H3>DOM Building</H3>

To build a DOM Tree we need to parse an XML file, or construct one from
scratch in memory using our application (See the various items of demo code
that will be good examples of this). While we have decided to build our own
DOM, we really don't want to get involved in the low level XML file parsing.
An application building its own structures in memory uses a completely
separate code path and we won't approach that topic here.
<P>

When parsing an XML file, we make use of the inbuilt SAX parser provided by
JAXP. This provides us with a serial stream of events as parts of the document
file are encountered. Using this information we can then build our own DOM
structures.
<P>

Building our own DOM starts in the <CODE>DocumentBuilder</CODE> class. This
provides all of the startup routine to kick the production of a DOM into gear.
Getting events back from the SAX parser requires a collection of interfaces
depending on what information is needed. These interfaces are presented on the
left side of Figure 3. For our implementation, we use all of the available
interfaces. The reason for this is that we also want to grab as much of the
DTD information as well as the raw XML structure. This will help us later on
create a better validated document, particularly if it starts getting
dynamically changed by an application.

<P>

<B>Figure 3:</B> UML Structure classes involved in the construction of a DOM
   tree from an XML file.
</CENTER>
<P>

With the information from the DTD, we use this to populate our
<CODE>ProfileInfo</CODE> class. As was mentioned earlier, this is our
repository of all our default attribute information. We start with an empty
document and then register each attribute definition from the DTD as SAX sends
it to us. If we don't have something registered here, then we assume that
there are no default attributes for that element.
<P>

If we are starting with a clean document, we want to pass to the ProfileInfo
class the list of profile names that we want supported. We then use that to
dynamically load a DTD and register the type information.
<P>

As we are parsing through the XML, we need to create elements and attributes
according to the data passed to us. For extensibility, we ask the factories to
produce these for us. If the factory cannot create an instance, we ignore the
element and keep working on the rest of the document. Also, in order to work
correctly, we also pass factory instances to the elements and document as
needed.

<H3>XML ID/IDREF Handling</H3>

An important part of a DOM representation is the ID attributes. These allow us
to uniquely identify a given element instance. The ID is produced as we are
parsing the document, but it is also possible that at runtime the code will
dynamically have an ID attribute set on a given node. Because it will be
directly set on a node, we need some way of feeding the information back to
the owner document about these identifiers.
<P>

One goal of the code is to maintain decoupling between classes. That is, we
can have a direct reference one way, but we don't want a class being completely
dependent on another. This gets really nasty to compile. Therefore, to allow
registration of ID information with the parent document, we have created the
interface and methods that can be seen in Figure 4.

<P>
<CENTER>

<IMG SRC="dom_id_structure_small.png" WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="118"></A><BR>
<B>Figure 4:</B> UML Structure classes involved in the handling of ID
   attribute types.
</CENTER>
<P>

When an attribute is set in the element, it is checked for being an ID type.
If it is, then it will call the interface to register the element itself as an
object that can be fetched. Similarly, when that attribute is removed from the
element it will be automatically unregistered.
<P>
<HR>

<A NAME="runtime">
<H2>Runtime Semantics</H2>
</A>

While the static structures seem fairly simple, there is quite a degree of
underlying complexity hidden. In the process of building a DOM and then
allowing users to interact with it, a fairly formal and strictly defined set
of interactions must take place internally in order to give the right outwards
appearance.
<P>

<H3>Conflicting Requirements</H3>

It is unfortunate that the current design is so rigid in the order that tasks
must be performed. The problem arises from the intersection of a number of
competeing requirements from different parts of XML and the DOM specifications
that has lead us to this situation. Ideally there is alternative implementation
paths, but at this point we haven't managed to discover any that would lead to
a more flexible environment.
<P>

To get a little more detailed, the problem mainly exists with the following
combination of requirements:

<UL>
<LI>The need to inform the parent document of the element's existance, (
    <CODE>getElementsByTagName()</CODE>)
<LI>Know and understand ID/IDREFs (need to inform parent document for
    <CODE>getElementsById()</CODE>)
<LI>DOM's requirements for default attributes to be always present in the
    DOM tree.
<LI>Path information for the node from this point to it's parent document for
    event propogation.
</UL>

Each of these require a separate set of data and only once we have everything
can we assume behaviour is correct. For example, if we remove the node ID
without knowing whether this is a default attribute, will we generate some
problem elsewhere when we later come along and set the default attribute
information.
<P>

In order to make sure that everything happens in the correct fashion, we have
hidden most of this behaviour in package private methods. If we let the user
supply lower level implementation items, then we just can't guarantee the
results, hence the requirements for the factories to return our classes in a
minimal state.

<H3>Building a document from XML</H3>

Building a DOM tree from an XML document takes several steps. The basic process
is based around the SAX parser feeding us events about what it has encountered
in a document. It is not in our interests to fully document the SAX handling,
but we will show here the effects of particular SAX events of interest.
<P>

Out basic building process is based on a stack. As you will notice, the DOM is
a tree structure. Each branch leads to a leaf or further branch and there is
no connected-ness between branches (ID/IDREFs do not count as connections
between branches in a DOM representation). Therefore, once we reach a leaf we
can back out one level to the parent branch and investigate the next branch.
What this makes for is a nice stack routine to build a DOM representation from
the current working branch and it's parent. The main working structure you will
find in the code is an array called <CODE>elementStack</CODE>. This is an array
rather than using the java provided <CODE>Stack</CODE>. The java class is a
hangover from the Java 1.0 days and is fully synchronised and therefore very
slow. For a fast parsing of a document, using our own array structure will be
much, much faster.
<P>

<H4>Initialising a document parser</H4>

The document parser initialisation starts in the JAXP code where it creates
a new <CODE>DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl</CODE>. This is the first class and
is responsible for collecting the properties and initialising the class
responsible for new documents and parser manager
<CODE>DocumentBuilderImpl</CODE>. With the builder created, we then have
multiple paths depending on what is required. Each of these is described in
the following series of diagrams.

<P>

<IMG SRC="dom_create_sequence_small.png" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="242"></A><BR>
<B>Figure 5:</B> Sequence of instructions to create a builder for parsing X3D
   documents.
</CENTER>
<P>

To create a document builder, we use the inbuilt SAX parser. To use this, we
use the JAXP provided default parser with the <CODE>SAXParserFactory</CODE>.
XML parsing does not actually occur until we have an <CODE>XMLReader</CODE>
instance so we go through a number of steps until we have an instance.
After this, we go through a setup process to configure the parser with the
information we need. <CODE>XMLReader</CODE> is the working class that does the
low level job of reading the text characters and then calling the SAX events.
In order for us to receive these events we need to register the right handlers.
Two of the methods are available directly on the <CODE>XMLReader</CODE> with
<CODE>setContentHandler()</CODE> and <CODE>setDTDHandler()</CODE>. The other
two interfaces we must set using the <CODE>setPropertyMethod()</CODE> with a
string indicating the property name.
<P>

At some later stage the user will want to parse a document. The process that
the code goes through is illustrated in Figure 6. The main point of note here
is that we set the entity resolver and error handler only once we attempt to
parse the document. This saves us potential problems of accidently setting
either of these while we are part way through the document.
<P>

Creating an actual <CODE>Document</CODE> instance is handled by the combination
of <CODE>XMLReader</CODE> and <CODE>X3DSAXDocumentBuilder</CODE>. The events
come from the parser into the builder and that holds our information about
the document. The <CODE>parse()</CODE> method does not return until the
document is finished. Once this is finished, we then ask the builder for the
document information that it has built from the SAX events. If there has been
a parsing error then we never get to this point as we let the exception
propogate back out through the method call.

   documents.

<P>


<H3>Sending an event</H3>

To send an event within the DOM we need something to happen. We may either
have the userland code request an event to be dispatched or the event is
created by our internal code when the user does something to the document
structure. To illustrate the event sending sequence illustrated in Figure 7,
we use the example of the user adding a new child node.
<P>

<B>Figure 7:</B> Sequence of instructions to send an example event (adding a
   node to a node).
</CENTER>
<P>

After some basic processing internally within <CODE>X3DNode</CODE>, we then
need to do the event sending steps. This takes place within a special internal
method called <CODE>sendInsertedEvent()</CODE>. Here we ask the event generator
class to create us a new event of the right type, and initialise it with the
appropriate values. For the diagramming purposes, we don't specify a particular
event type, rather we just talk about generics as the same process takes place
regardless of the event type or originator.
<P>

With an initialised event, we then ask the event dispatcher to take care of it.
Internally to the event dispatcher, it then determines whether the event is a
new one, or one that is arriving here because a propogation sequence has
already started. For new events, we now mark them as dispatched and start
calling methods according to the DOM Event specification for the event
propogation. Firstly we must send capture events, then send the event to the
target itself and finally bubble the event to the parents. It is not able to
be represented on the sequence diagram, but after each of these stages, if the
event has been stopped then we do no further processing and return to the
node to complete its work of adding the child node.

<P>
<HR>

<A NAME="components">
<H2>Extending the code</H2>
</A>

The basic code provides a simple DOM builder. As this project is aimed at
providing an X3D capability, the need to provided extended options is high.
This section documents how we extended the code to provide X3D specific
functionality and how you might want to extend it with new node types etc.

<H3>Adding new Element and Attributes</H3>

The most common requirement is the need to add new elements and attributes.
To do this, we use the two factory interfaces <CODE>ElementFactory</CODE>
<CODE>AttributeFactory</CODE> respectively.
<P>

<CODE>ElementFactory</CODE> provides us new element instances. During
parsing of the XML document or when the user calls
<CODE>Document.createElement()</CODE> the code delegates to this factory
instance. The factory is provided with the tag name of the element and profile
information. In return it expects an instance of <CODE>X3DElement</CODE>. This
instance should not be initialised in any way other than setting the tag name
value.
<P>

To create new attributes you provide an instance of
<CODE>AttributeFactory</CODE>. Under the same circumstances as elements,
attributes are created with an attribute name and value. As different elements
may have the same attribute names we also provide an X3DElement instance. This
is treated as an indicative element. The created attribute should not be set on
this element. It is to serve as an identifier for the parent element type for
the attribute to be created.
<P>

When we want to tell the implementation of the factory, we use the
<CODE>setAttribute()</CODE> method of <CODE>DocumentBuilderFactory</CODE>. The
string is the property name and the value is an instance of the appropriate
factory.

<H3>Sending New Event types</H3>

To send new event types, we need to create them ourselves. The inbuilt factory
is only capable of sending standard DOM event types. If the application that
is using the DOM wishes to send it's own custom event types then it must be
responsible for creating and initialising it with the right information. The
event class should extend the <CODE>DOMEvent</CODE> class of our
implementation. The event dispatch mechanism expects this class as it needs
some of the private methods for controlling the dispatching of the event.
<P>

Once the event has been created it is injected into the DOM Tree through the
<CODE>dispatchEvent()</CODE> method. Typically this is done at the top of the
document, but it may be inserted at the node depending on the requirements of
the application. By default events based on <CODE>DOMEvent</CODE> will not
bubble or be captured. From this point onwards the handling of the event
dispatch is handled by our internal mechanisms illustrated earlier.
