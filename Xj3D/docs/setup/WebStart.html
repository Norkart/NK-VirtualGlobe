<title>How to use Xj3D and WebStart</title>
</head>
<body>

The primary difference between the WebStart environment and the suggested system installation
of Xj3D is that under WebStart archive files are not added to the system class loader path
even when specified as system libraries.
<P>
Xj3D first tries to load its resources using various getSystemResource calls and then
attempts to use similar getResource calls using the classloader of the referencing class.
For example, IconManager uses
 IconLoader.class.getClassLoader().getResource("images/"+imageName)
to locate icons.  Thus the images directory must be in the same archive as the IconLoader
class file.  The same applies for the other classes which access configuration files or resources.
<P>
The project which motivated the WebStart capability uses a single archive for the Xj3D class files,
resources and configuration files, so xj3d-all.jar is the suggested starting point.  As such
the author of this document has done no experimenting on splitting the project into parts
which can be more easily updated and will not offer any information on that since
any information which could be offered would be incorrect.  This information will be revised
in the event that the situation changes.
<P>
The most important point to note in the current version is that the xj3d-skin.properties file goes
in the root directory of the archive, and that the base directory for the icons 
and cursors is the images directory.  For the rest of the property files which Xj3D uses
this author suggests that they be left where ever the build process sees fit to normally place them.
