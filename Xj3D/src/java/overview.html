<title>Xj3D 2.0 Overview</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>
Xj3D is a series of libraries that form a toolkit that can be used to
load and render VRML97 and X3D files.
</p>
<p>
The aim of the codebase is to provide a series of easily separable components
to enable VRML and X3D content either as a full browser, static geometry or
even as a component of a bigger application. The major goal of the code is to
provide a highly flexible <i>set</i> of libraries that you may take and use
to generate renderable content. If you combine them all together you could
create a complete browser that we intend to be spec-conformant. The codebase
itself is <i>not</i> a VRML/X3D browser, although you can create one from
this code (see some of the example and apps directories along with this distribution
for an idea how).
</p>
<p>
The code is broken into 5 major sections:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Low level VRML and X3D lexical parsers with a callback based API</li>
<li>Definitions of VRML and X3D content, structure and generators</li>
<li>Various renderer implementation of the internal structured scenegraph
    (OpenGL, Java3D, null and mobile)</li>
<li>Various utilties built over the frame work, such as compression systems
    and format transformation</li>
<li>Implementations of the EAI and external SAI to allow access to X3D/VRML
    content in a browser-independent, spec-conformant manner without you
    needing to get caught up in the details of Xj3D's internals.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the Code</h2>

<p>
When you start to use the code in an application, it will not automatically
allow you to do everything. For example, standard Java 3D loaders do not
support the idea of scripting or of Inline content. To deal with this, you
must also perform some auxillary support work so that everything works as
expected.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> In general, we recommend that you <i>only</i> use the SAI classes
to interact with Xj3D. By far the majority of the applications do not need
anything more complex than that interface.
</p>

<h3>Loading External Content</h3>

<p>
To make life easier for our implementation, we have made use of quite a number
of 3RD party libraries to build a fully capable browser. The major reason for
this is that the inbuilt Java libraries are pretty terrible for the
requirements of a VRML browser. Firstly we need full URI support - Java does
not handle URNs that are used by the Universal Media libraries. Next, the
image loading of standard Java is very bloated, consuming way too much
memory. Then, to transport them across to the texture mapping used we have
to make several copies of the image each time, so we bring in a library for
more efficient image handling.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to use local libraries for specific areas such as Java 3D
support. These libraries make a lot of things simpler by allowing us to not
have to code them again. There are many similarities between VRML and the
3D graphics scenegraph APIs and these libraries act as the translator between
the two systems.
</p>

<h3>Preparation Work</h3>

<p>
Internally the code does not connect a lot of the parts together. For example,
Inlines are not automatically loaded as there are cases where you don't want
the code to handle them. You may also want to specifically handle different
content. Therefore, the Inlines are only loaded once you register the
appropriate handlers with the URI system. We won't detail that here, but
refer you to the applicable packages - {@link org.web3d.net.content} and
{@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader}. There are a collection of properties
and factories that need to be set if you want loading of external files
like textures, scripts and Inlines to work correctly.
</p>

<h2>XML Integration</h2>

<p>
Xj3D can process X3D content that exists as part of a larger multinamespace
XML document. The exising X3D spec is currently not well defined about this,
so we have taken a few liberties until a firm specification is defined.
</p>

<p>
In the case where X3D is the containing document, and is the unnamespaced
portion of the XML elements, we handle this transparently. You need to do
nothing special. Any elements that have a namespace prefix are ignored and
disposed of during the parsing process by the Xj3D browser.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to apply a namespace to the X3D nodes, then we use a fixed URI to
detect this. If there is a <code>xmlns:</code> attribute on the X3D root
element, we look at the value of that attribute to determine if you are
declaring the namespace to be the X3D namespace. If we see the exact value of
</p>

<pre>
  <code>http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-namespace</code>
</pre>

<p>
Then we take the pre-defined prefix to be the X3D namespace prefix. For
example:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;X3D version='3.1' profile='Interchange'
 xmlns:x3dns='http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-namespace'
 xmlns:foo='http://www.foo.com/mynamespace'
 &gt;
 &lt;x3dns:head&gt;
 ...
</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>
&lt;X3D version='3.1' profile='Interchange'
 xmlns:bar='http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-namespace'
 xmlns:foo='http://www.foo.com/mynamespace'
 &gt;
 &lt;bar:head&gt;
 ...
</pre>

<p>
will both generate valid and identical X3D content for viewing.
</p>

<h2>System Properties</h2>

<p>
There are two ways of controlling the runtime configuration of Xj3D. Apart
from providing your own implementation of the various toolkits, the standard
Java mechanisms of properties files and system properties also apply.
</p>

<h3>Property Files</h3>

<p>
Property files are used to control large collections of properties. The
following properties files are used by the system (path information is
relative to the CLASSPATH as per System.getProperty()):
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>config/2.0/spec/vrml.properties</code></dt>
<dd>Defined by the EAI to control various
    items of configuration. Principally used to set the default factory class
    to use for {@link vrml.eai.BrowserFactory}
</dd>
<dt><code>config/3.<i>x</i>/spec/x3d.properties</code></dt>
<dd>Defined by the EAI to control various
    items of configuration. Principally used to set the default factory class
    to use for {@link vrml.eai.BrowserFactory}
</dd>
<dt><code>config/3.<i>x</i>/XMLcontainerfields.props</code></dt>
<dd>Mapping of node element names to the default containerField attribute
    value. Used when the XML parsing is not validating and so we don't get
    the values directly passed to us.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Configuration files are all kept in a directory
<code>config/<i>spec_version</i></code> with separate sub directories. These can
be overridden by the user as needed by providing their own replica directory
structure that is locatable within the CLASSPATH.
</p>

<h3>System Properties</h3>

<p>
The codebase makes reasonable use of system properties to allow the
modification of its behaviour. These properties are sprinkled liberally about
the code, making them sometimes hard to find. This is a summary of all those
properties. Please be aware that these will need to be set before you run any
code from this library because most of them will be used during the
construction phase of any class.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader.threads</code></dt>
<dd>The number of concurrent threads to be started to do loading. There are
    two areas which use this - script loading and all other files. Each loader
    creates this number of threads in the pool.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.parser.field.factory</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.web3d.vrml.parser.FieldParserFactory}
    interface, which is used for parsing individual field values.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.parser.file.factory</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.web3d.vrml.parser.VRMLParserFactory}
    interface, which is used for parsing files.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.script.loader.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader.ScriptLoader}
    interface, which is used for loading scripts.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.script.manager.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.runtime.ScriptManager}
    interface, which is used for managing scripts.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.file.loader.class</code></dt>
<dd>the name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.loader.ExternalLoadManager} interface,
    which is used for loading content other than scripts.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.router.manager.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.runtime.RouteManager}
    interface, which is used for managing routes.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.router.factory.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.runtime.RouterFactory}
    interface, which is used for creating routers.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.frame.state.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.FrameStateManager}
    interface, which is used for managing per-frame state.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.sensor.manager.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.renderer.j3d.input.J3DSensorManager} interface, which
    is used for managing sensors. There are renderer-specific sub-interfaces
    of this interface which the implementing class must also adhere to.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.xj3d.eventmodel.evaluator.class</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the
    {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.runtime.EventModelEvaluator} interface,
    which is used for runing the event model.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.staticgroup.dispose</code></dt>
<dd>Boolean value describing whether the static group should dispose of the
    VRML node children. This is an efficiency measure that will allow an
    implementation to remove unneeded memory. However, it also means
    that they can no longer be traversed, so if your application is
    trying to traverse the scene graph, it will not be able to use the
    nodes later on. Useful for a runtime optimisation, no good if you are
    writing an editor. Defaults to false.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.staticgroup.compact</code></dt>
<dd>Boolean value describing whether the static group should compact the VRML
    scenegraph below this node or leave it in an expanded state. This is
    an efficiency measure that will allow an implementation to flatten
    the scene graph if desired. Useful for debugging but also means the
    runtime scene graph will probably be different from the original
    loaded from file. Defaults to false.
</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.nodes.fontstyle.font.size</code></dt>
<dd>The font size in points. The default value is 36 point font.
</dd>
 <dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.shape.rescale</code></dt>
 <dd>The method to use for rescalling textures.  Valid values are
     "NEAREST_NEIGHBOR, BILINEAR"</dd>
 <dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.shape.useTextureCache</code></dt>
 <dd>Whether to cache textures for later reuse.  This caches by URL which might be incorrect
    for some dynamic systems.  It improve performance for files which don't use
    DEF/USE for textures.</dd>
 <dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.shape.maxTextureSize</code></dt>
    <dd>The maximum texture size to use.  By default texture sizes are unlimited.  Textures
    with a dimension over this value will be resized.  The resizing will try to
    preserve the aspect ratio.  This must be a power of two.</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.shape.useMipMaps</code></dt>
   <dd>Set to a value of "true" in order to generate mip maps for textures.</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.shape.anisotropicDegree</code></dt>
   <dd>Sets the anisotropic filtering degree.  Values above 1 cause mip mapping to
      be turned on as well.</dd>
<dt><code>org.web3d.vrml.renderer.ogl.nodes.hanim.allowHardwareHumanoid</code></dt>
    <dd>Set to a value of "true" in order to allow the use of hardware-accelarated
	rendering of the HAnim humanoid. Otherwise, always uses software rendering.</dd>
