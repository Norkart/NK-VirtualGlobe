<p>
Implementations of various content loading strategies that work with the
interfaces and structures defined in the package {@link org.xj3d.core.loading}.
</p>

<p>
The content loading process needs to be customised depending on the type of
content being loaded. For example, script loading needs to also access the
{@link org.web3d.vrml.scripting.ScriptEngine} interface during the load process
to see if a specific script type is supported, yet texture loading will not.
Each of the loaders in this package implement their respective loader
interfaces and make use of the global
{@link org.xj3d.core.loading.LoaderThreadPool} to schedule the loading.
