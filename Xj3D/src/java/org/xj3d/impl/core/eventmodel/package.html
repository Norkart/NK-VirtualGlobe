<p>
Default implementations of the event model implementations defined in the
package {@link org.xj3d.core.eventmodel}.
</p>

<p>
These classes implement the event model as per the X3D and VRML specifications.
Every attempt is made to be as conformant as possible to the wording of the
specifications. As such, they may not be the most efficient, but they are the
most correct. By default, these are the implementations used by the rest of the
browser.
