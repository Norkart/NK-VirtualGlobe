/**
 * A Java3D file loader implementation for reading X3D utf8 files only and
 * building a Java3D scenegraph with them.
 * <p>
 *
 * The loader considers sensor handling and routing to be behaviours. Some
 * asynchronous loading of files for textures is performed. Sound file loading
 * is performed if audio clips are asked for. For example, if behaviours are
 * not requested then Inlines will not have their content loaded.
 * <p>
 *
 * If the loader asks for no behaviors, then we will still load nodes that
 * use behaviors, but will disable their use. For example, a LOD will still
 * need to have all of the geometry loaded, just not shown or activated
 * because the LOD's internal behavior is disabled. Scripts are considered
 * to be behaviours, and they will not be loaded at all if behaviour loading
 * is disabled. However, we will take out other items. For example, we make
 * no attempt to load textures, scripts or anything else that may require
 * asynchronous loading of the content outside the single call to load().
 * <p>
 *
 * The default setup for runtime activities is
 * {@link org.xj3d.impl.core.eventmodel.ListsRouterFactory} and
 * {@link org.xj3d.impl.core.loading.MemCacheLoadManager}
