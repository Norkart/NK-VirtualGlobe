Implementations of Aviatrix3D file loaders for Web3D file formats.
<P>

All the files available here implement the
{@link org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d.loader.AVLoader} interface. For more
information on how to use loaders, see the
<a href="http://aviatrix3d.j3d.org/using/loaders.html">How to use the
Loader</a> page at aviatrix.j3d.org.
<p>

The loaders have two very different code paths depending on what you want to
do. If you need just static geometry then the loader will perform a blocking
load call and will not return until all of the world file is loaded. If the
world contains inlines then in will recurse into these and load them too before
returning to the caller. It will also disable all runtime aspects of the scene.
Scripts will have their initialize() method called, but nothing will be done
with the script or any changes it may make to the scene graph. If you have a
proto that depends on the script's initialize() method to build geometry, you
will not see it happen.
<p>
If you want the full runtime model of VRML/X3D as part of your loading process,
then you need to make sure you at least have the RUNTIMES flag set.
This will start up the full execution model and the content of the script will
run as normal. All user interaction will be applied, but due to the limitations
of the loader, things may not really function correctly. For example, clicking
on an Anchor node will not do anything, nor will viewpoint binding. Also, by
default, the navigation code is turned off. This is because we are assuming
that the user will probably use this to load multiple files over time or even
simultaneously. If the navigation code is running, each loaded file will be
fighting for the mouse events, control of the view and picking. Put a few of
these into a single scene simultanouesly, and there is no telling what will
happen!
