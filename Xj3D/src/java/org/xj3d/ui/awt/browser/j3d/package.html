Classes that are used to create or be a full browser.
<P>

The majority of these classes are used to support the EAI functionality so
that a user can create and manipulate a full VRML/X3D browser as part of
an application. The intention is that the programmer will never need to
deal with all the other classes provided by Xj3D and just stick with the
standards compliant EAI interface.
<P>
These particular classes are targeted at the Java3D renderer.
