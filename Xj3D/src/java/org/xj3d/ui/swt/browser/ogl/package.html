Classes that are used to create or be a full browser panel embedded within
an application using the OpenGL renderer.
<P>

The majority of these classes are used to support the EAI/SAI functionality
so that a user can create and manipulate a full VRML/X3D browser as part of
an application. The intention is that the programmer will never need to
deal with all the other classes provided by Xj3D and just stick with the
standards compliant EAI or SAI interface.
<p>

Creating a component using either of these interfaces starts with
registering the appropriate factory implementation with the EAI/SAI.
An end user should never have to do this, however as both standards
define a way for each browser to nominate itself as the implementation
of choice, through the use of Java properties files. To make sure you
are using the right implementation, look for either vrml97.properties
or x3d.properties in your CLASSPATH. Check that the entry is pointing
to the appropriate class from this package. After that, all you need
to do to use the SAI or EAI is to call the appropriate create method
from the factory API. If you find yourself needing to call the
<code>setBrowserFactoryImpl()</code> method then you are doing something
wrong as this now restricts the code to a particular SAI/EAI implementation.
This is wrong, and creates non-portable code.

<P>
These particular files are specific to the
