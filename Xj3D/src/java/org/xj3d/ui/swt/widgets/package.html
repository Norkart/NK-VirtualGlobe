<p>
A collection of SWT widgets that can be used in browser interfaces.
</p>

<p>
Each component is standalone, but typically interacts with the core of the
browser through the generic interfaces defined in {@link org.web3d.browser}.
As a general rule, the component will take the required interface classes
in the constructor and will self-register any listeners needed. Users should
not need to register the listeners themselves.
