Interface definitions that provide abstract representations of the
runtime processing of the X3D/VRML scenegraph (The event model).
<p>

Interfaces in this package are used to define abstract capabilities of the
runtime capabilities. It does not contain the implementations of any of the
interfaces. This allows for a pluggable interface for an end user to customise
the behaviour of the browser. In addition, the interfaces are designed to work
with the abstract node representations in the {@link org.xj3d.core.nodes}
package. In each case we can implement these without needing
to know about a specific rendering implementation of the nodes. The idea is
that you can take these and plug them in with the nodes interfaces and create
a complete working event model.

<h3>Route Management</h3>

Route management exists as an abstract system with different implementations.
All routes management implementations are based on the
{@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes.runtime.RouteManager}
interface. This interface serves to allow the rest of a browser implementation
to work regardless of the actual implementation while allowing your code to
experiment with differemt capabilites and optimisation routines. For example, you
could change the route handling from breadth first to depth first without
modifying any other code.

<h3>Bindables Management</h3>

There are a lot of uses for bindable nodes in the VRML scene graph. These all
follow the same behaviour, just the visual output is different. There is a lot of
behaviour that gets repeated over and over so this cleans up all of this into a
single neat package.

<h3>Properties</h3>

The following properties are in use by classes in this package.

<ul>
<li><code>org.xj3d.script.loader.class</code> The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.vrml.nodes.loader.ScriptLoader}
    interface, which is used for loading scripts.
</li>
<li><code>org.xj3d.script.manager.class</code> The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.vrml.nodes.runtime.ScriptManager}
    interface, which is used for managing scripts.
</li>
<li><code>org.xj3d.file.loader.class</code> The name of the class
    that implements the
    {@link org.vrml.nodes.loader.ExternalLoadManager} interface,
    which is used for loading content other than scripts.
</li>
<li><code>org.xj3d.router.manager.class</code> The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.vrml.nodes.runtime.RouteManager}
    interface, which is used for managing routes.
</li>
<li><code>org.xj3d.router.factory.class</code> The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.vrml.nodes.runtime.RouterFactory}
    interface, which is used for creating routers.
</li>
<li><code>org.xj3d.frame.state.class</code> The name of the class
    that implements the {@link org.vrml.nodes.FrameStateManager}
    interface, which is used for managing per-frame state.
</li>
</ul>
