Protocol handler implementation code to allow the Xj3D code to load inline
javascript and ecmascript scripts.
<p>

As our asynchronous load mechanism for Xj3D does not use the standard
<CODE>java.net</CODE> packages for loading external content, we extend the
classes used by our system. It can be used with the standard java.net system,
but will not use it for it's own internal loading.
<P>

<H2>Registering VRML Protocol Handlers</H2>

Protocol handlers are not automatically registered with the system. This means
that inlines will fail to load unless you register one of these handlers with
the URI resolver system <I>within your own code</I>. To register one, you need
to use the following code guide.

<PRE>
import org.ietf.uri.URI;
import org.ietf.uri.URIResourceFactory;

...

     URIResourceStreamFactory fac = URI.getURIResourceStreamFactory();
     if(!(fac instanceof Web3DResourceFactory)) {
         fac = new Web3DResourceFactory(fac);
         URI.setURIResourceStreamFactory(fac);
     }
</PRE>
<P>

There are a number of different protocol handler factories available. In
general, we recommend you stick with one of the Do It All factories that
handle all the types. The others are provided for completeness. Which you
choose depends on what version of the spec(s) you need to support.
<P>


If you wish to get the source for the URI system, the handler makes use of
Justin Couch's <A HREF="http://www.vlc.com.au/urilib">URIlib</A> Java library
for loading URNs and URLs. The standard <CODE>java.net</CODE> library is not
used. Note that if you are using URNs, you will need to set a few system
properties defined by that package.
