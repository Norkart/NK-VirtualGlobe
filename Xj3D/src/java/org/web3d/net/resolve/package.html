URN resolver implementation code to allow the Xj3D code to load any item that
defines a URN in it's URL field (eg EXTERNPROTO and ImageTexture).
<p>


<H2>Registering VRML URN Resolvers</H2>

URN resolvers are not automatically registered with the system. This means
that externprotos and other nodes will fail to load using the URN system unless
you register one of these handlers with the URI resolver system
<I>within your own code</I>. To register one, you need to use the following
code guide.

<PRE>
import org.ietf.uri.URN;
import org.ietf.uri.URNResolverService;

import org.web3d.net.resolve.Web3DURNResolverService;

...
    URNResolverService resolver = new Web3DURNResolver();

    resolver.registerPrefixLocation("geovrml", "c:\\Program Files\\GeoVRML");
    // add more calls here for other systems like UMEL

    URN.addResolver(resolver);
</PRE>

<P>
If you wish to get the source for the URI system, the handler makes use of
Justin Couch's <A HREF="http://www.vlc.com.au/urilib">URIlib</A> Java library
for loading URNs and URLs. The standard <CODE>java.net</CODE> library is not
used. Note that if you are using URNs, you will need to set a few system
properties defined by that package.
