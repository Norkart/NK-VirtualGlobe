Content handler implementation code to allow the Xj3D code to load inline
data or run as a standalone system without needing to use other loader
interfaces.
<p>

As our asynchronous load mechanism for Xj3D does not use the standard
<CODE>java.net</CODE> packages for loading external content, we extend the
classes used by our system. It can be used with the standard java.net system,
but will not use it for it's own internal loading.
<P>

<H2>Registering VRML Content Loaders</H2>

Content handlers are not automatically registered with the system. This means
that inlines will fail to load unless you register one of these handlers with
the URI resolver system <I>within your own code</I>. To register one, you need
to use the following code guide.

<PRE>
import org.ietf.uri.URI;
import org.ietf.uri.FileNameMap;

...

     ContentHandlerFactory fac = URI.getContentHandlerFactory();
     if(!(fac instanceof J3DContentHandlerFactory)) {
         fac = new J3DContentHandlerFactory(fac);
		 URI.setContentHandlerFactory(fac);
     }
</PRE>

<H2>Registering VRML file types</H2>

Under the standard Java setup, the VRML file types are not mapped. While you
will get the right information from a webserver, files fetched from the local
disk will not give you the right information. Therefore you will need to
register a mapping for the filename. To do this, we must create and register
an instance of a mapping - represented by the {@link org.ietf.uri.FileNameMap}
interface.
<P>

The registration process is very similar to the content handler factory
process:

<PRE>
import org.ietf.uri.URI;
import org.ietf.uri.FileNameMap;

...

     FileNameMap fn_map = URI.getFileNameMap();
     if(!(fn_map instanceof VRMLFileNameMap)) {
         fn_map = new VRMLFileNameMap(fn_map);
		 URI.setFileNameMap(fn_map);
     }
</PRE>


The URI packages are included as part of the CVS download or install and should
be registered in your classpath.
<P>
If you wish to get the source for the URI system, the handler makes use of
Justin Couch's <A HREF="http://www.vlc.com.au/urilib">URIlib</A> Java library
for loading URNs and URLs. The standard <CODE>java.net</CODE> library is not
used. Note that if you are using URNs, you will need to set a few system
properties defined by that package.
