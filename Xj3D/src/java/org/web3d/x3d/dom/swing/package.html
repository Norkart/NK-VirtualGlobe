Classes to represent the X3D DOM information with Swing components.
<P>

A variety of classes are provided here that allow you to represent DOM
information as a tree. Ideally the DOM is produced from an X3D document
as the renderers and information are constructed for that use. Other document
types can be supported, providing you supply the right factory
implementatations.
