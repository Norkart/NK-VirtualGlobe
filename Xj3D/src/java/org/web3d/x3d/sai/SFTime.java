 * Representation of a SFTime field.
 * <P>
 * Time values are represented as per the VRML IS specification Section
 * 4.11 Time. That is, time is set as VRML "Time" - the number of seconds since
 * Jan 1, 1970 GMT, rather than a Java time which is a long, the number
 * of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 GMT. To convert between the two simply
 * divide java time by 1000 and cast to a double.
 * <P>
 * Note that in setting time values from an external application, the idea of
 * the time that java represents and the time that the VRML world currently
 * has set may well be different. It is best to source the current "time" from
 * a node or eventOut in the VRML world rather than relying exclusively on
 * the value returned from <CODE>System.currentTimeMillies</CODE>. This is
 * especially important to note if you are dealing with high speed, narrow
 * interval work such as controlling animation.
