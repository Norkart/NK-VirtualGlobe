Generic classes for describing null renderer-specific extensions to the base
interfaces in the {@link org.web3d.vrml.nodes} package.
<p>

This package provides a lot of convenience classes for the base interfaces. You
are free to extend on these base interfaces when implementing new components or
to implement your own versions of the base interfaces.
