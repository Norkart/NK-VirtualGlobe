Common renderer-independent implementation for custom Xj3D extension supporting
rigid body physics modelling. 
<p>

The nodes here provide the basic field handling needed for the nodes, including 
checking for validity of code structure and ranges. A specific renderer would 
need to extend these nodes with their own interfaces with the specific 
rendering API. 

<h3>Specification</h3>

This is a custom extension to Xj3D. It will not work in any other browser.
