Common renderer-independent implementation for the field handling of the nodes in
the HAnim component.
<p>

The nodes here provide the basic field handling needed for the nodes, including 
checking for validity of code structure and ranges. A specific renderer would 
need to extend these nodes with their own interfaces with the specific 
rendering API.
