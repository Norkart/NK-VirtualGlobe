/**
 * OpenGL-renderer implementation of a TimeSensor node.
 * <p>
 *
 * The implementation uses the standard VRML time clock to send and retrieve
 * time information. As an efficiency measure, if the time sensor is disabled
 * it will remove itself as a listener to the global clock. When it becomes
 * re-enabled that listener will be added back again.
 * <p>
 *
 * When setting values we always set the variable first and then set the flag
 * indicating that the field has changed. This is so that we don't end up with
 * a multi-threaded access thinking that a value has changed when it really
 * hasn't (yet) and then ignoring the value. As we desperately try to avoid
 * synchronized access internally, we try to set the real value first so that
 * if someone does check and find it's changed, we can then give them the real
 * value as soon as they ask for it.
