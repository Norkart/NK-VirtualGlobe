General classes to allow the construction of a VRML scene graph that uses
OpenGL as the rendering mechanism.
<P>

The classes provided here are used for infrastructure purposes at the high
level for integrating with the various parts of the VRML rendering system.
In general, the classes here are designed to assemble a scene graph based on
{@link org.web3d.vrml.sav SAV} events and creating OpenGL based nodes.
<p>

The rendering API in use is Jausoft's GL4Java.
