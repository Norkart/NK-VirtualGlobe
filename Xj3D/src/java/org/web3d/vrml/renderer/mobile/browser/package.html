Classes needed to create a full VRML browser implementation based on the
nodes and other structures available in the API.
<P>

This package is a relatively high level approach to the concepts needed to
build a browser. It bases its work on the low level parsing and building
used in the {@link org.web3d.vrml.renderer.j3d.nodes J3D Nodes} package to
then assemble a full browser.
<P>

A browser may be accessible in one of a number of forms presented in this
package. You may start with just a single, simple window and go all the
way to a full browser package. It does not provide a full browser application
as that expects that you want to create a custom code for that.
