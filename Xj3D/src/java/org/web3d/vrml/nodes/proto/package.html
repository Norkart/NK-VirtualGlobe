Utility classes to load and represent PROTO and EXTERNPROTO nodes.
<p>

The core of this package is used to construct proto instances from the
file as it is being built. That instance remains in memory as a template
and can be used to create a runtime instance whenever required and with
whatever renderer is required.
<p>

This package will handle both protos and externprotos, but requires an
external loader to find, resolve and build those extern proto instances. As
far as the structures are concerned in this class, placeholder instances
are used to represent externprotos that are declared and used inside a
PROTO body. These will not be resolved until a runtime instance of the
PROTO is created.
