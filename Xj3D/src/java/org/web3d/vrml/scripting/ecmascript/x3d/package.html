Implementation of classes that are used as objects to rhino and X3D 
ecmascript nodes.
<P>

These objects are auxillary objects used by the specification. The end
user cannot directly instantiate them (as compared to the builtin package).
<p>

This script implementation is dependent on the Rhino Javascript engine from
the Mozilla project. The package is under the NPL 1.1 currently. You can
download the documentation and source from the
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino Homepage</A>
