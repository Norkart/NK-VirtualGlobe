Implementation of classes that are used as standard objects to rhino and
Javascript.
<P>

The package is designed to provide wrappers for both fields and for
standard objects like VrmlMatrix that the ecmascript appendix requires.
All classes in this package do not have any prefix, and just use the standard
names for the field types (eg SFColor, not ECMASFColor) because Javascript has
no way of disambiguating the name from the class name. Classes are declared
public, along with their constructors because that's what Rhino needs in order
to access them.
<P>
This script implementation is dependent on the Rhino Javascript engine from
the Mozilla project. The package is under the NPL 1.1 currently. You can
download the documentation and source from the
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino Homepage</A>
