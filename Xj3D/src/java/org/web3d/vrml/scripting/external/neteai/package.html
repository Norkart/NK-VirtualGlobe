The classes in this package provide the implementations for the networked
version of the EAI 2.0 
classes.
<P>
The networked EAI code is designed to implement synchronous remote service
requests without using Java RMI for the following reasons
 <UL>
   <LI>The author does not care for the overhead in Java serialization.</LI>
   <LI>Callbacks using Java RMI require polling in the real world situation
       of personal computers having firewalls.</LI>
   <LI>Java RMI is language specific.</LI>
   <LI>The author wanted to see how much work it was.</LI>
 </UL>
<P>
Instead the author has chosen to implement a simple packet scheme using
packet type indentifiers.  The packet format is described the documentation for 
NetworkProtocolConstants class.
<P>
On the client side a master processing thread is created which exists only
to perform the initial connection handshake, to wake up client requests
when their data arrives, and trigger event broadcasts.
<P>
When a client service request occurs, a SuspendedTaskData object is created, 
assigned an ID, and stored in a blocking task table.  After that the user thread is allowed
to transmit and then calls wait() until the data arrives.
<P>
When the data arrives the processing thread checks the packet's task ID, locates
and resumes the client thread and then blocks on the read lock until the client
thread finishes.
<P>
Requests for notification of events are handled by registering the listeners with the
non-rendering browser.  The non-rendering browser asks the rendering browser for the
appropriate updates and repeats the data to the appropriate listeners.
<P>
The important server side classes are NetworkBrowserServer, ServerProcess, 
ServerProcessingTask, and ServerBrowser.  ServerBrowserFactory is used simply
to avoid a compilation loop between ServerBrowser and the other classes.  The important
client side classes are NetworkBrowserFactoryImpl, NetworkBrowserClient, NetEAINode,
and ClientProcessingTask.  NetworkStartupListener is used to ensure that the constructor
for NetworkBrowserClient does not return until the network handshaking has completed and
the ClientProcessingTask is ready for user tasks.
<P>
For end user code, NetworkBrowserFactoryImpl is a BrowserFactoryImpl which implements
getBrowser(InetAddr,port) and performs the correct tasks to connect to a serving browser.
Serving browsers construct an instance of NetworkBrowserServer and end user code should
consult the documentation for the other BrowserFactoryImpl's for the parameters which
are needed to trigger that construction.
