The classes in this package provide the implementations for the EAI 2.0 
classes.
<P>
While these classes may show up in traceback messages, they are not intended
for use other than indirectly as produced by the browser factories and
similar clases.
<P>
<H1>General notes</H1>
At the suggestion of Justin Couch and Alan Hudson, the EventIn wrapper classes
serve double duty as both buffers in the incoming event processing system
and as the user visible field representations.  This should eliminate the
need for a full buffer pool system for everything except users sending
events on a field every single frame.
<P>
Further, the EventOut instances sent as part of the VrmlEventListener
callbacks are part of the event out buffering system, and client 
implementations are advised not to retain references to those event outs
because they are aggressively reused.
