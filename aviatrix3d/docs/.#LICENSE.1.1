Each directory is given relative to the root of the tree as checked out
from CVS.

  All code under the /src directory
  All code under the /make directory

  Most of the pre-compiled libraries contained under /lib
    (need more specific detail on this)

  All code under /examples

Documents under /docs are not currently assigned a license, thus
redistributable under standard copyright terms.

to find out in each specific case.
